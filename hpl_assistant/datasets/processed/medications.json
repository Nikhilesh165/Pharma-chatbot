      "indications": "Indications\n1. Hypertension\n2. Congestive heart failure\n3. Treatment of patients who - within the first few days after an acute myocardial \ninfarction - have demonstrated clinical signs of congestive heart failure. \n4. Prevention of myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death and \nreduction of need for revascularization procedures in patients with an \nincreased cardiovascular risk such as manifestation of coronary heart disease \n(with or without a history of myocardial infarction), a history of stroke, or a \nhistory of peripheral vascular disease.\n5. Prevention of myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death in diabetic \npatients.\n6. Prevention of progressive renal failure in patients with persistent proteinuria \nin excess of 1 gday.",
      "dosage": "Dosage\nThe dosage is based on the desired effect and on how the patient tolerates the \nmedicine. Therapy with Acecard is usually long-term therapy. The doctor \ndetermines the duration of treatment individually for each patient.\nTreatment of hypertension:\nThe recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily. Depending on the response, \nthe dose may be increased by doubling the dose at intervals of 2 to 3 weeks. \nThe usual maintenance dose is 2.5 to 5 mg daily, the maximum dose is 10 mg \ndaily.\nTreatment of congestive heart failure.\nThe recommended initial dose is 1.25 mg once daily. Depending on the \nresponse, the dose may be increased by doubling the dose at intervals of 1 to 2 \nweeks. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg. The required daily dose, if equaling or \nexceeding 2.5 mg, may be taken as a single dose or in two separate doses.\nTreatment after myocardial infarction:\nThe recommended initial dose is 5 mg daily, divided into two single doses of 2.5 \nmg each, one in the morning and one in the evening. If this dose is not well \ntolerated 1.25 mg should be taken twice daily over two days. In either event, \ndepending on the response, the dose may then be increased by doubling the \ndose at intervals of 1 to 3 days. As treatment progresses, the total daily dose \nmay be taken as a single dose. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg.\nSufficient experience is still lacking in the treatment of patient with severe \n(NYHA-IV) heart failure immediately after myocardial infarction. Treatment, if \nnevertheless given, should be started with 1.25 mg once daily, and increased \nonly particular caution.\nPrevention of myocardial infarction, stroke of cardiovascular death:\nThe recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily. Depending on the \ntolerability, the dose is gradually increased by doubling the dose after one week. \nThree weeks later, it should be doubled again to the usual maintenance dose of \n10 mg.\nPrevention of progressive renal failure:\nRecommended initial dose is 1.25 mg once daily which should be doubled at \nintervals of 2-3 weeks depending on the tolerability.\nIn all cases: In patients pre-treated with a diuretic, consideration must be given \nto discontinuing the diuretic for at least 2 to 3 days before starting treatment \nwith Acecard, or at least to reducing the diuretic dose. The initial dose in such \npatients is generally 1.25 mg Acecard.\nIn impaired liver or renal function, response to treatment may be either \nincreased or reduced. Therefore, treatment must be initiated only under close \nmedical supervision. The maximum daily dose is 2.5 mg. Administration\nThe tablets must be swallowed without chewing and with sufficient amounts of \nliquid (approx. 12 glass). They may be taken before, during, or after a meal.",

      "contraindications": "Contraindications\nAcecard must not be used in patients with\n-\tHypersensitivity to Ramipril, any other ACE inhibitor, or to any of the excipients.\n-\tA history of angioneurotic oedema \n-\tHaemodynamically relevant renal artery stenosis either bilateral or unilateral in \nthe single kidney.\n-\tLow blood pressure or labile circulatory condition (risk of fall in blood pressure \nand renal failure).\nSince severe rapid-onset and allergy-like (anaphylactoid hypersensitivity) \nreactions may occur, treatment with ACE inhibitors in conjunction with \nextracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with negatively charged \nsurfaces must be avoided. \nPregnancy and lactation\nAcecard must not be taken during pregnancy. \nIf treatment with Acecard is necessary during lactation, breast-feeding must be \navoided in order to prevent the infant from ingesting small quantities of Ramipril \nwith breast milk.\nInteractions\nExtracorporeal treatments evolving blood contact with negatively charged \nsurfaces carry the risk of severe anaphylactoid reactions.\nWhen potassium salts or potassium-sparing diuretics are given concurrently, a \nrise in serum potassium concentration may occur. Concomitant treatment with \npotassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. spiranolactone) or with postassiurn salts must \nbe accompanied by close monitoring of serum potassium\nACE inhibitors may potentiate the effect of antidiabetic agents (e.g. insulin or \nsulfonylurea derivatives). In isolated cases this may lead to an excessive \nreduction in blood sugar levels (hypoglycemic reactions). \nAdverse reactions\nAn excessive reduction in blood pressure may occur, particularly after initial or \nincreased doses of Acecard or of an additional diuretic, and may sometimes \nprogress to shock.

      "composition": "Composition\nAdalimab 40 mg injection: Each pre-ﬁlled syringe contains 0.8 \nml sterile solution of Adalimumab INN 40 mg.\nPharmacology\nAdalimumab is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody speciﬁc for human tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Adalimumab binds speciﬁcally to TNF-alpha and blocks its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab also lyses surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inﬂammatory and immune \nresponses. Elevated levels of TNF are found in the synovial ﬂuid \nof patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Juvenile Idiopathic \nArthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, and Ankylosing Spondylitis and play an important role in both the pathologic inﬂammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased levels of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In \nPlaque Psoriasis, treatment with Adalimumab may reduce the \nepidermal thickness and inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells.\nIndications\nAdalimumab is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker indicated \nfor treatment of: \n  Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): Reducing signs and \nsymptoms, inducing major clinical response, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with moderately to severely active RA\n  Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA): Reducing signs and \nsymptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA in patients 2 years of age and older\n  Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA): Reducing signs and symptoms, \ninhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with active PsA\n Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS):  Reducing signs and \nsymptoms in adult patients with active AS\n Adult Crohns Disease (CD):  Reducing signs and \nsymptoms and inducing and maintaining clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohns disease who have had an inadequate response to \nconventional therapy.

In case of sepsis or risk of sepsis. Treatment with Adalimumab should not be initiated in patients with serious active infections, including chronic or localized infection. \nWarning and precautions for use\nSerious infections: Do not start Adalimab\n during an active \ninfection. If an infection develops, monitor carefully, and stop Adalimab\n if infection becomes serious.\nInvasive fungal infections: For patients who develop a systemic illness on Adalimab\n, consider empiric antifungal \ntherapy for those who reside or travel to regions where mycoses are endemic.\nMalignancies:  Incidence of malignancies was greater in \nAdalimab\n-treated patients than in controls Anaphylaxis or \nserious allergic reactions may occur.Hepatitis B virus reactivation: Monitor HBV carriers during \nand several months after therapy. If reactivation occurs, stop \nAdalimab\n and begin antiviral therapy.Demyelinating disease:  Exacerbation or new onset, may \noccur.\nCytopenias, pancytopenia:  Advise patients to seek \nimmediate medical attention if symptoms develop, and \nconsider stopping Adalimab. \nHeart failure: Worsening or new onset, may occur.\nLupus-like syndrome: Stop Adalimab if syndrome develops \nTuberculosis: As cases of tuberculosis have been reported in \npatients treated with Adalimumab, your doctor will check for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis before starting \nAdalimumab. This may include a thorough medical history, a \nchest X-ray and a tuberculin test. The conduct of these tests \nshould be recorded on the Patient Alert Card. It is very important that you tell your doctor if you or the child have ever had tuberculosis, or have been in close contact with someone who has had tuberculosis.\nIf symptoms of tuberculosis (such as persistent cough, weight \nloss, listlessness, mild fever), or any other infection appear during or after therapy, tell your doctor immediately.\nBlood disorders: Seek medical advice immediately if you or \nthe child has any signs or symptoms such as persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding or paleness. Such symptoms may point to the existence of potentially life-threatening blood disorders, which may require discontinuation of Adalimumab.\nChickenpox: Consult your doctor if you or the child is exposed \nto chickenpox when using Adalimumab. Your doctor will determine if preventive treatment for chickenpox is appropriate.\nLatex:  The needle cover is made from latex (dry natural \nrubber). Contact your doctor before using Adalimumab if the \nneedle cover will be handled by, or Adalimumab will be given \nto, someone with a known or possible hypersensitivity (allergy) to latex.\nAlcohol abuse:  Adalimumab should not be used for the \ntreatment of hepatitis related to alcohol abuse. Please tell your \ndoctor if you or the children in your care have a history of \nalcohol abuse.\nWegeners granulomatosis: Adalimumab is not \nrecommended for the treatment of Wegeners granulomatosis, a rare inﬂammatory disease. If you or the children in your care have Wegeners granulomatosis, talk to your doctor.\nAnti-diabetic medicines:  Tell your doctor if you or the \nchildren have diabetes or are taking medicines to treat \ndiabetes. Your doctor may decide if you or the child need less \nanti-diabetic medicine while taking Adalimumab.\nPossible side effects\nThe most common adverse reaction with Adalimumab was injection site reactions (erythema andor itching, hemorrhage, pain or swelling). The most common adverse reactions leading \nto discontinuation of Adalimumab in rheumatoid arthritis were \nclinical ﬂare reaction, rash and pneumonia. Other adverse reactions of Adalimumab includes- Gastrointestinal disorders: Diverticulitis, large bowel perforations including perforations associated with diverticulitis and appendiceal perforations associated with appendicitis, pancreatitis .\nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions: Pyrexia \nHepato-biliary disorders: Liver failure, hepatitis \nImmune system disorders: Sarcoidosis Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspeciﬁed (including cysts \nand polyps):  Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine \ncarcinoma of the skin) Nervous system disorders: Demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic \nneuritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome), cerebrovascular accident \nRespiratory disorders: Interstitial lung disease, including \npulmonary ﬁbrosis, pulmonary embolism \nSkin reactions:  Stevens Johnson Syndrome, cutaneous \nvasculitis, erythema multiforme, new or worsening psoriasis (all \nsub-types including pustular and palmoplantar), alopecia \nVascular disorders: Systemic vasculitis, deep vein thrombosis.Pregnancy and lactationPregnancy Category B Adequate and well controlled studies with Adalimumab have \nnot been conducted in pregnant women. Adalimumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody and IgG1 is actively transferred across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy.\nLactation\nLimited data from published literature indicate that \nAdalimumab is present in low levels in human milk and is not likely to be absorbed by a breastfed infant. However, no data is available on the absorption of Adalimumab from breast milk in \nnewborn or preterm infants. Caution should be exercised when \nAdalimumab is administered to a nursing woman.\nPediatric Use \nSafety and efﬁcacy of Adalimumab in pediatric patients for uses other than polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and pediatric Crohns disease have not been established.\nOverdose\nNo Dose limiting toxicity was observed during clinical trials. The highest dose level evaluated has been multiple doses of 10 mgkg, which is 15 times the recommended dose.\nStep 1: Setting up for an injection \n1. Select a clean, well-lit, ﬂat working surface.2. Take the Adalimab\n carton containing the pre-ﬁlled syringes \nout of the refrigerator and place it on a ﬂat work surface. \nStarting from one of the top corners, pull back the paper cover from the top and sides of the tray.

Each \nnew injection should be given at least 3 cm from an old site. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid areas with scars or stretch marks. (It may be helpful to keep notes on the location of the previous injections.)\n3. If you have psoriasis, you should try not to inject directly into \nany raised, thick, red, or scaly skin patches (psoriasis skin lesions).\nStep 3: Injecting the Adalimab\n solution\n1. Wipe the site where Adalimab is to be injected with the \nalcohol swab, using a circular motion. Do not touch this area again before giving the injection.\n2. Pick up the pre-ﬁlled syringe from the ﬂat work surface. \nRemove the needle cover by ﬁrmly pulling it straight off the syringe (see Diagram 2). Be careful not to bend or twist the cover during removal to avoid damage to the needle.When you remove the needle cover, there may be a drop of liquid at the end of the needle; this is normal. Do not touch the needle or allow it to touch any surface. Do not touch or bump the plunger. Doing so could cause the liquid to leak out.\nDiagram 2\n3. When the cleaned area of skin has dried, pinch and hold it \nﬁrmly with one hand. With the other hand, hold the syringe like a pencil.\n4. With a quick, short motion, push the needle all the way into \nthe skin at an angle between 45 and 90 (see Diagram 3). With experience, you will ﬁnd the angle that is most comfortable for you. Be careful not to push the needle into the skin too slowly, or with great force.\nDiagram 35. When the needle is completely inserted into the skin, release \nthe skin that you are holding. With your free hand, hold the \nsyringe near its base to stabilise it. Then push the plunger to \ninject all of the solution at a slow, steady rate\n    (see Diagram 4).\nDiagram 4\n6.  When the syringe is empty, pull the needle out of the skin, \nbeing careful to keep it at the same angle as inserted. There \nmay be a little bleeding at the injection site. You can press a cotton ball or gauze over the injection site for 10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. If needed, you may cover the injection site with a bandage.\nStep 4: Disposing of supplies\n  The pre-ﬁlled syringe is for single-use administration only. \nThe syringe and needle should never be reused. Never recap a needle. Dispose of the needle and syringe as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. If you have any questions, please talk to a doctor, nurse or pharmacist who is familiar with Adalimab\n.\nCommercial pack\nAdalimab  40 mg pre-ﬁlled syringe injection: Each box \ncontains 1 pre-ﬁlled syringe containing 0.8 ml sterile solution of \nAdalimumab INN 40 mg and one alcohol pads.\nStorage\n  Adalimumab should be stored in refrigerator at 2-8 oC.\n  Do not freeze.\n  Do not shake.\n  Keep away from light.\n13001392 Medicine: Keep out of reach of children\nManufactured by\nHealthcare Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\nGazariapara, Mirzapur, Rajendrapur\nGazipur-1703, Bangladesh",

Adalimumab binds speciﬁcally to TNF-alpha and blocks its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Adalimumab also lyses surface TNF expressing cells in vitro in the presence of complement. TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inﬂammatory and immune \nresponses. Elevated levels of TNF are found in the synovial ﬂuid \nof patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Juvenile Idiopathic \nArthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, and Ankylosing Spondylitis and play an important role in both the pathologic inﬂammation and the joint destruction that are hallmarks of these diseases. Increased levels of TNF are also found in psoriasis plaques. In \nPlaque Psoriasis, treatment with Adalimumab may reduce the \nepidermal thickness and inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells.\nIndications\nAdalimumab is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker indicated \nfor treatment of: \n  Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): Reducing signs and \nsymptoms, inducing major clinical response, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with moderately to severely active RA\n  Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA): Reducing signs and \nsymptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA in patients 2 years of age and older\n  Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA): Reducing signs and symptoms, \ninhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with active PsA\n Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS):  Reducing signs and \nsymptoms in adult patients with active AS\n Adult Crohns Disease (CD):  Reducing signs and \nsymptoms and inducing and maintaining clinical remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohns disease who have had an inadequate response to \nconventional therapy.

The highest dose level evaluated has been multiple doses of 10 mgkg, which is 15 times the recommended dose.\nStep 1: Setting up for an injection \n1. Select a clean, well-lit, ﬂat working surface.2. Take the Adalimab\n carton containing the pre-ﬁlled syringes \nout of the refrigerator and place it on a ﬂat work surface. \nStarting from one of the top corners, pull back the paper cover from the top and sides of the tray. Remove pre-ﬁlled \nsyringe and one alcohol swab and place them on your work \nsurface. Do not shake the pre-ﬁlled syringe of Adalimab\n. \nPlease follow last section for instructions on how to store Adalimab\n. If you have any questions about storage, contact \nyour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist for further instructions.\n3. You should allow 15 to 30 minutes for the Adalimab \nsolution in the syringe to reach room temperature. Do not remove the needle cover while allowing it to reach room temperature. Waiting until the solution reaches room \ntemperature may make the injection more comfortable for \nyou. Do not warm Adalimab\n in any other way (for example, \ndo not warm it in a microwave or in hot water).\n4. Assemble the additional supplies you will need for your \ninjection.

Do not use \nthe solution if it is discoloured, cloudy, or if particles other than those described above are present. If you are concerned with the appearance of the solution, then contact \nyour pharmacist for assistance.\nStep 2: Choosing an injection site\n1. Three recommended injection sites for Adalimab using a \npre-ﬁlled syringe include: (1) the front of the middle thighs; \n(2) the abdomen, except for the 5 cm area right around the navel; and (3) the outer area of the upper arms (see Diagram 1). If you are self injecting, you should not use the outer area of the upper arms.\nDiagram 1\n2. A different site should be used for each new injection. Each \nnew injection should be given at least 3 cm from an old site. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid areas with scars or stretch marks. (It may be helpful to keep notes on the location of the previous injections.)\n3. If you have psoriasis, you should try not to inject directly into \nany raised, thick, red, or scaly skin patches (psoriasis skin lesions).\nStep 3: Injecting the Adalimab\n solution\n1. Wipe the site where Adalimab is to be injected with the \nalcohol swab, using a circular motion. Do not touch this area again before giving the injection.\n2. Pick up the pre-ﬁlled syringe from the ﬂat work surface. \nRemove the needle cover by ﬁrmly pulling it straight off the syringe (see Diagram 2). Be careful not to bend or twist the cover during removal to avoid damage to the needle.When you remove the needle cover, there may be a drop of liquid at the end of the needle; this is normal. Do not touch the needle or allow it to touch any surface. Do not touch or bump the plunger. Doing so could cause the liquid to leak out.\nDiagram 2\n3. When the cleaned area of skin has dried, pinch and hold it \nﬁrmly with one hand. With the other hand, hold the syringe like a pencil.\n4. With a quick, short motion, push the needle all the way into \nthe skin at an angle between 45 and 90 (see Diagram 3). With experience, you will ﬁnd the angle that is most comfortable for you. Be careful not to push the needle into the skin too slowly, or with great force.\nDiagram 35. When the needle is completely inserted into the skin, release \nthe skin that you are holding. With your free hand, hold the \nsyringe near its base to stabilise it. Then push the plunger to \ninject all of the solution at a slow, steady rate\n    (see Diagram 4).\nDiagram 4\n6.  When the syringe is empty, pull the needle out of the skin, \nbeing careful to keep it at the same angle as inserted. There \nmay be a little bleeding at the injection site. You can press a cotton ball or gauze over the injection site for 10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. If needed, you may cover the injection site with a bandage.\nStep 4: Disposing of supplies\n  The pre-ﬁlled syringe is for single-use administration only. \nThe syringe and needle should never be reused. Never recap a needle. Dispose of the needle and syringe as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. If you have any questions, please talk to a doctor, nurse or pharmacist who is familiar with Adalimab\n.\nCommercial pack\nAdalimab  40 mg pre-ﬁlled syringe injection: Each box \ncontains 1 pre-ﬁlled syringe containing 0.8 ml sterile solution of \nAdalimumab INN 40 mg and one alcohol pads.\nStorage\n  Adalimumab should be stored in refrigerator at 2-8 oC.\n  Do not freeze.\n  Do not shake.\n  Keep away from light.\n13001392 Medicine: Keep out of reach of children\nManufactured by\nHealthcare Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\nGazariapara, Mirzapur, Rajendrapur\nGazipur-1703, Bangladesh",

      "composition": "Composition\nEach film coated tablet contains Flupentixol Hydrochloride BP equivalent to Flupentixol 0.5 mg and Melitracen  \nHydrochloride INN equivalent to Melitracen 10 mg.\nClinical Pharmacology\nPharmacological effects\nAngenta consists of two well known and well proven compounds: flupentixol-a neuroleptic with anxiolytic and \nantidepressant properties of its own when given in small doses, and melitracen-a bipolar thymoleptic with \nactivating properties in low doses. In combination the compounds render a preparation with antidepressant, \nanxiolytic and activating properties.\nPharmacokinetics\nMaximal serum concentration is reached in about 4 hours after oral administration of flupentixol and in about 4 \nhours after oral administration of melitracen. The biological half-life of flupentixol is about 35 hours and that of \nmelitracen is about 19 hours. The combination of flupentixol and melitracen does not seem to influence the \npharmacokinetic properties of the individual compounds.\nIndications\nAnxiety-Depression-Apathy\nPsychogenic depression. Depressive neurosses. Masked depression. Psychosomatic affections accompanied by \nanxiety and apathy. Menopausal depressions. Dysphoria and depression in alcoholics and drug-addicts.\nDosage  and Administration\nAdults:\nusually 2 tablets daily: morning and noon. In severe cases the morning dose may be increased to 2 tablets.\nElderly patients: 1 tablet in the morning.\nMaintenance dose: Usually 1 tablet in the morning.\nIn cases of insomnia or severe restlessness additional treatment with a sedative in the acute phase is \nrecommended.\nContraindications\nThe immediate recovery phase after myocardial infarction. Defects in bundle-branch conduction. Untreated narrow \nangle glaucoma. Acute alcohol, barbiturate and opiate intoxications. Angenta should not be given to patients who \nhave received a MAO-inhibitor within two weeks. Not recommended for excitable or overactive patients since its \nactivating effect may lead  to exaggeration of these characteristics.\nAdverse effects\nIn the recommended doses side effects are rare. These could be transient restlessness and insomnia.\nPrecautions\nIf previously the patient has been treated with tranquillizers with sedative effect these should be withdrawn \ngradually.\nUse during pregnancy and lactation\nAngenta should preferably not be given during pregnancy and lactation.\nDrug interactions\nAngenta may enhance the response to alcohol, barbiturates and other CNS depressants. Simultaneous \nadministration of MAO-inhibitors may cause hypertensive crises. Neuroleptics and thymoleptics reduce the \nantihypertensive effect of guanethidine and similar acting compounds and thymoleptics enhance the effects of \nadrenaline and noradrenaline.\nOverdosage\nSymptoms: In cases of overdosage the symptoms of intoxications by melitracen, especially of anticholinergic \nnature, dominate. More rarely extrapyramidal symptoms due to flupentixol occur.\nTreatment: Symptomatic and Supportive. Gastric lavage should be carried out as soon as possible and activated \ncharcoal may be administered. Measures aimed at supporting the respiratory and cardiovascular systems should \nbe instituted. Epinephrine (adrenaline) must not be used for such patients. Convulsions may be treated with \ndiazepam and extrapyramidal symptoms with biperiden.\nPacks\nAngenta tablet: Each box contains 10x10 tablets in blister pack.\nStorage\nStore in a cool and dry place below 30ºC. \nProtect from light.\n  Medicine: Keep out of reach of children\nManufactured by\nHealthc are Pharmaceutic als Ltd.\nRajendrapur , Gazipur , Banglade sh",

      "description": "DESCRIPTION\nLinezolid is a synthetic, antibacterial agent belonging to a new class of antibiotics, the oxazolidinones, with in vitro activity against Gram positive \naerobic bacteria, some Gram positive anaerobic bacteria and certain Gram negative bacteria. It selectively inhibits bacterial protein synthesis via \na mechanism of action different from that of other antibacterial agents. Linezolid binds to the 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit of the \nbacterial ribosome and prevents the formation of a functional 70S initiation complex which is an essential component of the bacterial translation \nprocess. The results of time-kill studies have shown Linezolid to be bacteriostatic against enterococci and staphylococci. For streptococci, \nLinezolid was found to be bactericidal for the majority of strains.",
      "composition": "COMPOSITION\nAnulid Tablet 400 mg: Each film-coated tablet contains Linezolid USP 400 mg.\nAnulid Tablet 600 mg: Each film-coated tablet contains Linezolid USP 600 mg.\nAnulid Powder for Suspension: After reconstitution each 5 mL contains Linezolid USP 100 mg.",
      "indications": "INDICATIONS\nVancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus faecium infections including cases with concurrent bacteremia. Nosocomial pneumonia caused by \nStaphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains) or Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multi-drug resistant strains). \nCombination therapy may be clinically indicated if the documented or presumptive pathogens include Gram-negative organism. Complicated \nskin and skin structure infections, including diabetic foot infections (without concomitant osteomyelitis) caused by Staphylococcus aureus \n(methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes or Streptococcus agalactiae. Uncomplicated skin and skin \nstructure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible only) or Streptococcus pyogenes. Community-acquired \npneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (including multi-drug resistant strains) including cases with concurrent bacteremia or \nStaphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only).",
      "dosage": "DOSAGE  \nPatients who commence treatment on the parenteral formulation may be switched to oral presentation when clinically indicated. In such \ncircumstances, no dose adjustment is required as Linezolid has an oral bioavailability of approximately 100. The injection should be \nadministered over a period of 30 to 120 minutes. The film-coated tablets or oral suspension may be taken with or without food. ADMINISTRATION  \nReconstitution of Oral Suspension: Shake the bottle to loosen powder. Add 65 ml (with the help of given cup) of boiled and cooled water to the \ndry mixture in the bottle. For the ease of preparation, add water to the bottle in two portions. Shake well after each addition until all the powder \nis in suspension.\nNote: Shake the suspension well before each use. Keep the bottle tightly closed. The reconstituted suspension should be stored in a cool and dry \nplace. Use within 21 days after constitution.\nCONTRA-INDICATION\nLinezolid formulations are contraindicated for using in patients who have known hypersensitivity to Linezolid or any of the other product \ncomponents. Linezolid should not be used in patients taking any medicinal product which inhibits monoamine oxidases A or B (e.g. Phenelzine, \nIsocarboxazid) or within two weeks of taking any such medicinal product. Linezolid should not be administered to patients with uncontrolled \nhypertension, pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, carcinoid syndrome andor patients taking directly and indirectly acting sympathomimetic \nagents (e.g. Pseudoephedrine), vasopressive agents (e.g. Epinephrine, Norepinephrine), dopaminergic agents (e.g. Dopamine, Dobutamine), \nserotonin re-uptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin 5-HT1 receptor agonists (triptans), meperidine or buspirone.\nWARNING & PRECAUTION\nPatients who develop recurrent nausea or vomiting, unexplained acidosis or low bicarbonate level while receiving Linezolid should receive \nimmediate medical evaluation. Where administration of Linezolid and concomitant serotonergic agents are clinically appropriate, patients should \nbe closely observed for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome such as cognitive dysfunction, hyperpyrexia, hyperreflexia and \nincoordination. If signs or symptoms occur, physicians should consider discontinuation of either one or both agents. If the concomitant \nserotonergic agent is withdrawn, discontinuation symptoms can be observed. If patients experience symptoms of visual impairment, such as \nchanges in visual acuity, changes in color vision, blurred vision or visual field defect, prompt ophthalmic evaluation is recommended. Convulsions \nhave been reported in patients when treated with Linezolid. In some of these cases, a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures was reported.\nSIDE EFFECTS\nMost of the adverse events reported with Linezolid were mild to moderate in intensity. The most common adverse events in patients treated with \nLinezolid were diarrhea, headache and nausea. Other adverse events include oral moniliasis, vaginal moniliasis, hypertension, dyspepsia, \nlocalized abdominal pain, pruritus, and tongue discoloration.\nUSE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\nPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Linezolid should be used during pregnancy only if \nthe potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether Linezolid is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are \nexcreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Linezolid is administered to a nursing woman.\nDRUG INTERACTIONS\nMonoamine Oxidase Inhibition: Linezolid is a reversible and nonselective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Therefore, Linezolid has the potential \nfor interaction with adrenergic and serotonergic agents. Adrenergic Agents: Some individuals receiving Linezolid may experience a reversible \nenhancement of the pressor response to indirect-acting sympathomimetic agents, vasopressor or dopaminergic agents. Initial doses of \nadrenergic agents such as dopamine or epinephrine should be reduced and titrated to achieve the desired response.\nSerotonergic Agents: Physicians should be alert to the possible signs and symptoms of serotonergic syndrome in patients receiving concomitant \nLinezolid and serotonergic agents.\nOVERDOSAGE\nNo cases of overdose have been reported. Symptomatic and supportive care is advised together with maintenance of glomerular filtration. \nApproximately 30 of a Linezolid dose is removed during 3 hours of haemodialysis. No data are available for the removal of Linezolid by \nperitoneal dialysis or haemoperfusion.\nSTORAGE\nStore at temparature not exceeding 30 C in a dry place. Protect from light & moisture.\nCOMMERCIAL PACK\nAnulid Tablet 400 mg:  Each box contains 20 tablets in 2x10s blister strips.\nAnulid Tablet 600 mg: Each box contains 12 tablets in 2x6s blister strips.\nAnulid Powder for Suspension: Each box contains 1 bottle of 100 mL Powder for Suspension and a cup.

      "description": "Description\nDiclofenac Sodium is a potent nonsteroidal \nantiinflammatory drug (NSAID) with marked analgesic \nand antipyretic properties. It also has some uricosuric \neffects. The action of Diclofenac appeared to be \nassociated with the inhibition of prostaglandin \nsynthesis. Diclofenac may inhibit synthesis of \nprostaglandins by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an \nenzyme that catalyses the formation of prostaglandin \nprecursors from arachidonic acid. Peak plasma \nconcentration is achieved within half an hour following \ninjection. Lidocaine is the most widely used local \nanaesthetic drug. It acts more rapidly and is more \nstable than most other local anaesthetics. It is a very \nuseful surface anaesthetic. Like other local \nanaesthetics, Lidocaine impairs the generation and \nconduction of nerve impulses by slowing \ndepolarization. The onset of anaesthesia of Lidocaine \nHydrochloride is more rapid and the duration is 1-2 \nhours.",

      "indications": "Indications\nThe injection contains Diclofenac Sodium that is used \nto relief all grades of pain and inflammation in a wide \nrange of conditions including: a) Arthritic conditions \nsuch as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, juvenile \nchronic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, acute gout. b) \nAcute musculoskeletal disorders such as periarthritis \n(e.g., Frozen shoulder), tendinitis, tenosynovitis, bursitis. \nc) Other painful conditions resulting from trauma \nincluding, fracture, low back pain, sprains, strains, \ndislocations, control of pain and inflammation in \northopaedic, dental and other minor surgeries, \npostoperative pain, pain of renal colic etc. \nThe injection also contains Lidocaine which acts as a \nlocal anaesthetic. Therefore the possibility of pain at \nthe injection site, which is most likely to occur after \nintramuscular injection, is minimized if the Arthrofen \nPlus (Lidocaine containing) injection is used in the \nabove indications.",
      "dosage": "Dosage and Administration\nAdult: One ampoule once (or in severe cases, twice) \ndaily by intramuscular injection.\nRenal colic: One ampoule once daily intramuscularly. A \nsecond dose may be administered after 30 minutes if \nnecessary. \nChildren: In Juvenile chronic arthritis, 1-3 mg of \nDiclofenac Sodium per kg body weight daily in divided \ndoses. \nElderly patients: In elderly or debilitated patients, the \nlowest effective dosage is recommended, \ncommensurate with age and physical status, or as \nprescribed by the physician. \nSide Effects\nSide effects to Diclofenac Sodium and Lidocaine \ninjection are usually mild and transient. However if \nserious side effects occur the injection should be \ndiscontinued. Gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, \ndiarrhea and occasionally bleeding may occur. In very \nrare instances, injection site disorder may occur. In \nisolated cases, abscesses and local necrosis may \noccur. The adverse effects due to Lidocaine mainly \ninvolve the CNS, are usually of short duration, and are \ndose related. The CNS reactions may be manifested by \ndrowsiness, dizziness, disorientation, confusion, \nlightheadedness etc.",

Avibactam does not decrease the activity of ceftazidime against \nceftazidime-susceptible organisms.\nIndications\n Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (cIAI)\n Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (cUTI), including Pyelonephritis\n Hospital-acquired Bacterial Pneumonia and Ventilator-associated Bacterial Pneumonia (HABPVABP)\nMethod of Administration\nAvycef is supplied as a dry powder, which must be constituted and subsequently diluted, using aseptic technique prior to \nintravenous infusion.\nReconstitution Direction\na) Constitute the powder in the Avycef vial with 10 mL of one of the following solutions: \n Sterile water for injection, USP \n 0.9 of sodium chloride injection, USP (normal saline) \n 5 of dextrose injection, USP \n All combinations of dextrose injection and sodium chloride injection, USP, containing up to 2.5 dextrose, USP, and 0.45 \nsodium chloride, USP, or \n Lactated Ringers injection, USP \nb) Mix gently and ensure that the contents are dissolved completely. The constituted Avycef solution will have an approximate \nceftazidime concentration of 167 mgmL and an approximate avibactam concentration of 42 mgmL. The final volume is \napproximately 12 mL. The constituted solution is not for direct injection. The constituted solution must be diluted before \nintravenous infusion. \nc) Prepare the required dose for intravenous infusion by withdrawing the appropriate volume determined from the following \ntable from the constituted vial. \nd) Before infusion, dilute the withdrawn volume of the constituted Avycef solution further with the same diluent used for \nconstitution of the powder (except sterile water for injection), to achieve a ceftazidime concentration of 8 to 40 mgmL and an \navibactam concentration of 2 to 10 mgmL in an infusion bag. If sterile water for injection was used for constitution, use any of \nthe other appropriate constitution diluents for dilution. \ne) Mix gently and ensure that the contents are dissolved completely. Visually inspect the diluted Avycef solution (for \nadministration) for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the color of the Avycef infusion solution for \nadministration ranges from clear to light yellow). \nf) Use the diluted Avycef solution in the infusion bags within 12 hours when stored at room temperature. \ng) The diluted Avycef solution in the infusion bags may be stored under refrigeration at 2 to 8  C up to 24 hours following \ndilution and used within 12 hours of subsequent storage at room temperature. \nOverdosage\nIn the event of overdose, discontinue Avycef and institute general supportive treatment. Ceftazidime and avibactam can be \nremoved by hemodialysis.",

      "composition": "Composition\nBaritinib Tablet 2 mg: Each film-coated tablet contains Baricitinib \nINN 2 mg.\nBaritinib Tablet 4 mg: Each film-coated tablet contains Baricitinib \nINN 4 mg.\nIndications \n Rheumatoid arthritis: Baricitinib is indicated for the treatment of \nmoderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who \nhave responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more \ndisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Baricitinib may \nbe used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate\n Atopic Dermatitis:  Baricitinib is indicated for the treatment of \nmoderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients who are \ncandidates for systemic therapy\nClinical pharmacology \nBaricitinib is a selective and reversible inhibitor of Janus kinase JAK1 \nand JAK2. Janus kinases (JAKs) are enzymes that transduce \nintracellular signals from cell surface receptors for a number of \ncytokines and growth factors involved in haematopoiesis, \ninflammation and immune function. Within the intracellular signalling \npathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate signal transducers and \nactivators of transcription (STATs), which activate gene expression \nwithin the cell. Baricitinib modulates these signalling pathways by \npartially inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2 enzymatic activity, thereby reducing \nthe phosphorylation and activation of STATs.\nDosage and administration \n Rheumatoid arthritis: The recommended dose of Baricitinib is 4 \nmg once daily. A dose of 2 mg once daily is appropriate for patients \nsuch as those aged  75 years and may be appropriate for patients \nwith a history of chronic or recurrent infections \nA dose of 2 mg once daily may also be considered for patients who \nhave achieved sustained control of disease activity with 4 mg once \ndaily and are eligible for dose tapering.\n Atopic Dermatitis: The recommended dose of Baricitinib is 4 mg \nonce daily. A dose of 2 mg once daily is appropriate for patients such \nas those aged  75 years and may be appropriate for patients with a \nhistory of chronic or recurrent infections. A dose of 2 mg once daily \nshould be considered for patients who have achieved sustained \ncontrol of disease activity with 4 mg once daily and are eligible for \ndose tapering \nBaricitinib can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. The \nefficacy of Baricitinib can be enhanced when given with topical \ncorticosteroids. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be used, but should \nbe reserved for sensitive areas only, such as the face, neck, \nintertriginous and genital areas.\nConsideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients \nwho show no evidence of therapeutic benefit after 8 weeks of \ntreatment.\nMethod of administration\nOral use. Baricitinib is to be taken once daily with or without food and \nmay be taken at any time of the day.\nUse in specific populations\n Hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment is required in patients \nwith mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Baricitinib is not \nrecommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment\n Renal impairment: The recommended dose is 2 mg once daily in \npatients with creatinine clearance between 30 and 60 mLmin. \nBaricitinib is not recommended for use in patients with creatinine \nclearance  30 mLmin\nDrug interactions\nThe recommended dose is 2 mg once daily in patients taking OAT3 \ninhibitors with a strong inhibition potential, such as probenecid\nUse in pregnancy & lactation\n Pregnancy: Baricitinib is contraindicated during pregnancy. Women \nof childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during \nand for at least 1 week after treatment. If a patient becomes pregnant \nwhile taking Baricitinib the parents should be informed of the \npotential risk to the foetus\n Lactation: Not recommended\nUse in pediatric & geriatric patients\n Pediatric patients: The safety and efficacy of Baricitinib in children \nand adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been established Geriatric patients: Clinical experience in patients  75 years is very \nlimited and in these patients a starting dose of 2 mg is appropriate\nContraindications \n Known hypersensitivity to Baricitinib or any of its excipients\n Baricitinib is not recommended during pregnancy\nSide effects\nCommon side effects include throat and nose infections, high levels \nof cholesterol, cold sores, gastroenteritis, urinary infection, \npneumonia, high number of platelets, headache, nausea, stomach \npain, high levels of liver enzymes, rash, acne, increase in creatine \nkinase. \nWarnings and precautions\n Serious infections: Avoid use of Baricitinib in patients with active, \nserious infection, including localized infections. If a serious \ninfection develops, interrupt Baricitinib therapy until the infection is \ncontrolled\n Tuberculosis: Prior to initiating Baricitinib, test patients for latent \ntuberculosis (TB). If positive, consider treating for TB prior to \nBaricitinib use. Do not give Baricitinib to patients with active \ntuberculosis\n Haematological abnormalities: Baricitinib initiation is not \nrecommended in patients with an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) \n0.5x109 cellsL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1x109 cellsL, or \nhemoglobin level 8 gdL\n Viral reactivation: If a patient develops herpes zoster, Baricitinib \ntreatment should be temporarily interrupted until the episode \nresolves. If HBV DNA is detected, a liver specialist should be \nconsulted to determine if treatment interruption is warranted\n Vaccination: Use with live, attenuated vaccines during, or \nimmediately prior to, Baricitinib therapy is not recommended. Prior \nto initiating Baricitinib, it is recommended that all patients be \nbrought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with \ncurrent immunisation guidelines\n Lipids: Dose dependent increases in blood lipid parameters were \nreported in patients treated with Baricitinib \n Hepatic transaminase elevations: If increases in ALT or AST are \nobserved and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, Baricitinib \nshould be temporarily interrupted until this diagnosis is excluded\n Malignancy: Immunomodulatory medicinal products may increase \nthe risk of malignancies including lymphoma\n Venous thromboembolism: Baricitinib should be used with caution \nin patients with risk factors for DVTPE, or patients undergoing \nsurgery and immobilization. If clinical features of DVTPE occur, \nBaricitinib treatment should be discontinued and patients should \nbe evaluated promptly, followed by appropriate treatment\n Immunosuppressive medicinal products: Combination with biologic \nDMARDs, biologic immunomodulators or other Janus kinase (JAK) \ninhibitors is not recommended\n Hypersensitivity: If any serious allergic or anaphylactic reaction \noccurs, Baricitinib should be discontinued immediately\n Diverticulitis: Baricitinib should be used with caution in patients \nwith diverticular disease and especially in patients chronically \ntreated with concomitant medications associated with an increased \nrisk of diverticulitis. Patients presenting with new onset abdominal \nsigns and symptoms should be evaluated promptly for early \nidentification of diverticulitis or gastrointestinal perforation \nStorage \nStore at temperature not exceeding 3 0C in a dry place.

The dose may be increased if the desired therapeutic \neffect is not achieved.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\nBisoprolol & Amlodipine combination is contraindicated in \npatients with acute heart failure, high grade aortic stenosis, \ncardiogenic shock, second or third degree AV block, sick sinus \nsyndrome, slowed heart rate, symptomatic bradycardia, \nsymptomatic hypotension, severe bronchial asthma and \nhypersensitivity to Bisoprolol, Amlodipine or any of the \nexcipients.\nPRECAUTION\nCentrally Acting Antihypertensive Drugs (e.g. Clonidine, \nMethyldopa, Moxonidine, Rilmenidine): Concomitant use of \nthese drugs with Bisoprolol may lead to reduction of heart rate \nand cardiac output as well as to vasodilation. CYP3A4 \nInhibitors: Concomitant use of amlodipine with strong or \nmoderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. protease inhibitors, azole \nantifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, \nverapamil or diltiazem) can be expected to increase the plasma \nconcentrations of amlodipine to a clinically relevant extent.\nAnesthetic Agents: In combination with Bisoprolol, the reflex \ntachycardia may be attenuated and the risk of hypotension \nmay be increased.\nCardiac glycosides (Digitalis): Concomitant use with Bisoprolol \nmay lead to a reduction of heart rate or an increase of \natrio-ventricular conduction time.\nSIDE EFFECTS\nHeadache, drowsiness, dizziness, bradycardia.USE IN PREGNANCY AND LACTATION\nPregnancy:  Bisoprolol & Amlodipine combination is not \nrecommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.\nNursing mothers:  It is not known whether Bisoprolol or \nAmlodipine is excreted in human milk.\nUSE IN CHILDREN AND GERIATRIC PATIENTS\nChildren: Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have \nnot been established. Geriatric Patients:  No dosage \nadjustment is required. However, caution is advised when the \ndose is increased.\nDRUG INTERACTIONS\nCentrally Acting Antihypertensive Drugs (e.g. Clonidine, \nMethyldopa, Moxonidine, Rilmenidine): Concomitant use of \nthese drugs with Bisoprolol may lead to reduction of heart \nrate and cardiac output, as well as to vasodilation.

Since limited data suggest that Bisoprolol fumarate is not dialyzable, drug \nreplacement is not necessary in patients undergoing \ndialysis.Geriatric Patients: It is not necessary to adjust the dose in the elderly, unless there is also significant renal or hepatic dysfunction.\nPediatric Patients: There is no pediatric experience with \nBisoprolol.\nContraindication\nBisoprolol is contraindicated in patients with \ncardiogenic shock, overt cardiac failure, second or third degree AV block, and marked sinus bradycardia.\nUse In Pregnancy And Lactation\nPregnancy: Bisoprolol should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If treatment with Bisoprolol is considered necessary, the uteroplacental blood flow and the foetal growth should be monitored. \nIn case of harmful effects on pregnancy or the foetus, \nalternative treatment should be considered. The newborn infant must be closely monitored. Symptoms of hypoglycaemia and bradycardia are generally to be expected within the first 3 days.Lactation: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Therefore, breast-feeding is not \nrecommended during administration of Bisoprolol.\nSide Effects\nFatigue, dizziness, headache, disturbances of the gut such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation or abdominal pain, cold or numb extremities, e.g. hands and feet, muscle weakness or cramps, slower than normal heart beat (bradycardia), worsening of heart failure, sleep disturbance, depression, breathing difficulties due to a narrowing of the airways (bronchospasm) in people with asthma or COPD.\nPrecaution\nImpaired renal or hepatic function: Use caution in adjusting the dose of Bisoprolol in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Risk of anaphylactic reaction: While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine \nused to treat allergic reaction.\nOverdosage\nThe most common signs expected with overdosage of a beta-blocker are bradycardia, hypotension, congestive heart failure, bronchospasm, and hypoglycemia. Only a few cases of overdose with Bisoprolol have been reported. Bradycardia andor hypotension were noted. Sympathomimetic agents \nwere given in some cases, and all patients recovered. \nIn general, if overdose occurs, Bisoprolol therapy \nshould be stopped and supportive and symptomatic \ntreatment should be provided.\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30  \n0 C in a dry \nplace.

The results demonstrated no significant effect of bevacizumab on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan or its active metabolite SN38. \nUse in specific populations\nPregnancy Risk Summary:  Bevacizumab may cause \nfetal harm based on findings from animal studies and the drugs mechanism of action.\nLactation \nNo data are available regarding the presence of bevacizumab in human milk, the effects on the breast fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Human IgG is present in human milk, but published data suggest that breast milk antibodies do not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from bevacizumab, advise a nursing woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Bevacizumab.\nFemales and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception \nFemales Bevacizumab may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Bevacizumab and for 6 months following the last dose of Bevacizumab. \nInfertility Females \nBevacizumab increases the risk of ovarian failure and may impair fertility. Inform females of reproductive potential of the risk of ovarian failure prior to starting treatment with Bevacizumab. Long term effects of Bevacizumab exposure on fertility are unknown. In a prospectively designed substudy of 179 premenopausal women randomized to receive chemotherapy with or without Bevacizumab, the incidence of ovarian failure was higher in the Bevacizumab arm (34) compared to the control arm (2). After discontinuation of Bevacizumab and chemotherapy, recovery of ovarian function occurred in 22 (732) of these Bevacizumab-treated patients.\nPediatric Use  \nThe safety, effectiveness and pharmacokinetic profile of Bevacizumab in pediatric patients have not been established. In published literature reports, cases of non-mandibular osteonecrosis have been observed in patients under the age of 18 years who have received Bevacizumab. Bevacizumab is not approved for use in patients under the age of 18 years. Antitumor activity was not observed among eight children with relapsed glioblastoma treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan. There is insufficient information to determine the safety and efficacy of Bevacizumab in children with glioblastoma.Animal Data Juvenile cynomolgus monkeys with open growth plates exhibited physeal dysplasia following 4 to 26 weeks exposure at 0.4 to 20 times the recommended human dose (based on mgkg and exposure). The incidence and severity of physeal dysplasia were dose-related and were partially reversible upon cessation of treatment.\nGeriatric Use In Study Severe adverse events that occurred at a higher incidence ( 2) in patients aged  65 years as \ncompared to younger patients were asthenia, sepsis, deep thrombophlebitis, hypertension, hypotension, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, leukopenia, anemia, dehydration, hypokalemia, and hyponatremia. The effect of Bevacizumab on overall survival was similar in elderly patients as compared to younger patients.\nOverdosage \nThe highest dose tested in humans (20 mgkg IV) was associated with headache in nine out of 16 patients and with severe headache in three out of 16 patients.",
      "warnings": "Warnings and precautions\nPerforation or Fistula:  Discontinue Bevacizumab if \nperforation or fistula occurs. \nArterial Thromboembolic Events or ATE (e.g., myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction):\n Discontinue Bevacizumab \nfor severe ATE. \nVenous Thromboembolic Events or VTE:  Discontinue \nBevacizumab for lifethreatening VTE.  \nHypertension:  Monitor blood pressure and treat \nhypertension.

Diacerein directly inhibits Interleukin-1 (IL-1) \nsynthesis (main cytokine involved in cartilage destruction) and activity on the synthesis of proteoglycans, and hyaluronic acid, the principal component of cartilage. Reduces finger joint and knee osteoarthritis. Glucosamine:Glucosamine Sulfate stimulates the formation of collagen, which is the protein portion of the fibrous substances that hold joints together. Collagen is the main component of the shock absorbing cushion i.e articular cartilage, the white smooth surface which covers the ends of the body joints in the finger, wrist, etc. \nPharmacokinetics\nDiacerein: Oral bioavailability of Diacerein 56. Concurrent \nintake of food delays the time to peak concentration but associated with a 25 increase in absorption. Therefore, diacerein is best given with food. Mainly binds with protein albumin. Diacerein is metabolized extensively (100) in liver following oral dosing. Urinary excretion of diacerein in the form of its metabolites has ranged between 35 and 60. \nGlucosamine :\nIn humans, about 90 percent of glucosamine, administered as an oral dose of glucosamine sulfate, is absorbed from the digestive tract.

      "composition": "Composition:\nEach tablet contains-\nAscorbic acid USP 1000mg.\n(Equivalent to Vitamin C 1000mg)\nProperties and Effects:\nVitamin C is readily absorbed from the \ngastrointestinal tract and is widely \ndistributed in the body tissues. It is believed \nto be involved in biological oxidations and \nreductions used in intracellular respiration. \nIt is essential for the synthesis of collagen \nand intracellular material. Vitamin C \ndeficiency develops when the dietary intake \nis inadequate and when increased demand \nis not fulfilled. Deficiency leads to the \ndevelopment of the well defined syndrome \nknown as scurvy, which is characterized by \ncapillary fragility, bleeding (especially from \nsmall blood vessels and the gums), \nanaemia, cartilage and bone lesions and \nslow healing of wounds.\nCevion can be used to treat Vitamin C \ndeficient conditions and in those conditions \nwhere there is an increase in the \nrequirement.\nIndications:\nCevion is indicated for the prevention and \ntreatment of scurvy. It may be indicated in \npregnancy, lactation, infection, trauma, \nburns, cold exposure, following surgery, \nfever, stress, peptic ulcer, cancer, \nmethaemoglobinaemia and in infants \nreceiving unfortified formulas. It is also \nprescribed for hematuria, dental caries, \npyorrhea, acne, infertility, atherosclerosis, \nfractures, leg ulcers, hay fever, vascular \nthrombosis prevention, levodopa toxicity, \nsuccinyl-choline toxicity, arsenic toxicity etc.\nDosage:\n1 tablet daily or as prescribed by the \nphysician.Precautions:\nIt should be given with caution to patient \nwith hyperoxaluria and thalassaemia.\nSide Effects:\nLarger dose may cause diarrhoea, \nheadache, nausea, vomiting. A pregnant \nwoman taking more than 5gday may suffer \nfetal abortion. High doses as 10gm daily \nmay lead to formation of kidney oxalate \nstones. Very high doses may lead to \ndisturbed water and electrolyte balance, \nincreased red blood cell lysis, rebound \nscurvy and suppression of cobalamine \nactivity.\nDrug Interaction:\nVitamin C increases the apparent half life of \nparacetamol.\nVitamin C is incompatible in solution with \naminophylline, bleomycin, erythromycin, \nsulfafurazole, chloramphenicol, chlorthiazide \nsodium and hydrocortisone sodium \nsuccinate.\nStorage:\nStore in a cool & dry place below 300C\nProtect form heat & moisture.\nKeep out of reach of children.\nHow Supplied: \nCevion 1000; Tube containing 10 \neffervescent tablets.\n Keep the tube tightly closed after useCevion \nAscorbic Acid USP\nHP 520 91Manufactured by\nHealthc are Pharmaceutic als Ltd.\nRajendrapur , Gazipur , Banglade sh",

      "description": "Description\nClacido is an antibacterial combination consisting of the antibiotic Amoxicillin and the Beta-lactamase inhibitor \nClavulanic acid. Amoxicillin has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive & gram-negative \nmicroorganisms but it is susceptible to degradation by beta-lactamases and therefore the spectrum of activity does not \ninclude microorganisms, which produce these enzymes. Clavulanic acid possesses the ability to inactivate a wide range \nof beta-lactamase enzymes commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. Thus Clavulanic acid in Clacido\n protects Amoxicillin from degradation by beta-lactamase enzymes and effectively extends \nthe antibiotic spectrum to embrace a wide range of microorganisms.",

      "indications": "Indications\nClacido is indicated for short-term treatment of bacterial infections at the following sites: \n Upper respiratory tract infections (including ENT) e.g. recurrent tonsillitis, sinusitis, otitis media. \n Lower respiratory tract infections e.g. acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, lobar and bronchopneumonia.\n Genito-urinary tract infections e.g. cystitis, urethritis, pyelonephritis. \n Skin and soft tissue infections. Bone and joint infections e.g. osteomyelitis.  Other infections e.g. intra-abdominal sepsis, septic abortion, puerperal sepsis, septicaemia, peritonitis, post-surgical infections.",

For \nmore severe infections and infections of the respiratory tract, the dose should be one Clacido 1 gm tablet every 12 \nhours or one Clacido 625 mg tablet every 8 hours.  \nSuspensionPediatric Patients\nNeonates and Infants Aged 12 weeks (3 months): The recommended dose of Clacido\n is 30 mgkgday divided every 12 hours\nPatients Aged 12 weeks (3 months) and Older: \nPatients Weighing 40 kg or more: Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or more should be dosed according to adult \nrecommendations. The normal duration of treatment was 7 to 10 days.\nClacido\n may be taken without regard to meals; however, absorption of Clavulanate potassium is enhanced when \nAmoxicillinClavulanic acid is administered at the start of a meal. To minimize the potential for gastrointestinal intolerance, AmoxicillinClavulanic acid should be taken at the start of the meal.\nI.V. Injection\nAdults and children over 12 years: Usually 1.2 g eight hourly. In more serious infections, increase frequency to six-hourly intervals. \nChildren 3 months-12 years: \nUsually 30 mgkg eight hourly. In more serious infections, increase frequency to six-hourly intervals. \nChildren 0-3 months: \n30 mgkg eight hourly (every 12 hours in the perinatal period and in premature infants).\nAdult dosage for surgical prophylaxis:\nThe usual dose is 1.2 g  at the induction of anaesthesia , for high risk of infection, (e.g. colorectal surgery) may require three and up to four doses of 1.2 g intravenous in a 24-hour period.\nDosage in renal impairment\nAdults\nChildren\nSimilar reductions in dosage should be made for children.\nDosage in hepatic impairment \nDose with caution; monitor hepatic function at regular intervals.",

      "composition": "Composition\nClonatril 0.5 mg Tablets (cross-scored):  tablets containing clonazepam USP 0.5 mg.\nClonatril 1 mg Tablets (cross-scored) :  tablets containing clonazepam USP 1.0 mg.\nClonatril 2 mg Tablets (cross-scored) :  tablets containing clonazepam USP 2.0 mg.\nPharmacology\nClonazepam has pharmacological properties characteristic of the benzodiazepine class of drugs. Clonazepam has sedative, hypnotic and anticonvulsant properties. Its basic anticonvulsive properties are also similar to \nthose of other benzodiazepines.\nIndications\nAnxiety as well as panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia.  Epilepsy and other seizure disorders.\nDosage and administration\nStandard dosage: The dosage of Clonatril\n must be individually adjusted according to the patients clinical \nresponse and tolerance of the drug. As a general rule, Clonatril is given as low-dose, single-drug therapy in \nnew, non-therapy-resistant cases.\nOral treatment in Epilepsy: To avoid adverse reactions at the beginning of therapy, it is essential to increase the \ndaily dose progressively until the maintenance dose suited to the individual patient has been reached. The \ninitial dose for infants and children up to the age of ten years (or up to 30 kg bodyweight) is 0.01-0.03 mgkg daily. For children over ten years (or over 30 kg) and for adults, the recommended initial dose is 1-2 mg daily.The maintenance dose for infants and children up to the age of ten years (or up to 30 kg body-weight) is \n0.05-0.1 mgkg daily. For children 10-16 years or over (or over 30 kg) a dose of 1.5-3 mg daily and for adults a \ndose of 2-4 mg daily is recommended. Once the maintenance dose level has been reached, the daily amount \nmay be given in a single dose in the evening. The maximum therapeutic dose for adults is 20 mg daily. \nIn Panic Disorder: Clonazepam provides twice-a-day dosing schedule in panic disorder, which is generally well \ntolerated.  Clonazepam is usually started at a dosage of 0.25 to 0.5 mg twice a day and gradually increased by 0.25 to 0.5 mg every three to five days. Most patients with panic are effectively maintained on clonazepam 1 to \n3 mgday BID, although some patients may require higher dosage of 6 to 8 mg day. A three to four weeks \nperiod should be considered to reach the maximum tolerated dose. Gradual tapering is also necessary when discontinuing the drug, as abrupt cessation may result seizures, anxiety, headaches and insomnia. Clinicians are generally advised to taper the dosage of Clonazepam by approximately 0.25 to 0.5 mg a week. Tapering in even smaller decrements may be necessary in the final phases.\nDuration: At least three months or according to the response. For some patients with panic disorder, six to \neight months or even one - year treatment may be required.Pediatric Patients: There is no clinical trial experience with Clonatril in panic disorder patients under 18 years of age.\nRestrictions on use\nContraindications: Clonatril\n must not be used in patients with known hypersensitivity to clonazepam or any of \nthe drugs excipients, in patients dependent on medication, drugs of abuse or alcohol, or in patients suffering \nfrom myasthenia gravis. Clonatril may be used only with particular caution in patients with spinal or \ncerebellar ataxia, in the event of acute intoxication with alcohol, other antiepileptic drugs, hypnotics, analgesics, neuroleptic agents, antidepressants or lithium, in patients with severe liver damage (e.g., cirrhosis \nof the liver) or in patients suffering from sleep apnea. Precautions: The dosage of Clonatril\n must be carefully \nadjusted to individual requirements in elderly patients, patients with preexisting disease of the respiratory \nsystem (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), liver or kidneys, and in patients undergoing treatment \nwith other centrally acting medications or anticonvulsant (antiepileptic) agents (see Interactions). Like all \ndrugs of this type, Clonatril may, depending on dosage, administration and individual susceptibility, modify \nthe patients reactions (e.g. driving ability, behaviour in traffic). Pregnancy, nursing mothers: Animal studies have demonstrated that Clonatril\n has undesirable effects on the fetus (teratogenicity, embryotoxicity or other \neffects) but no controlled trails have been carried out so far in pregnant women. Under these circumstances, the drug should only be administered to pregnant women if the potential benefits outweigh the risk to the \nfetus. During pregnancy, Clonatril\n may be administered only if there is a compelling indication. \nAdministration of high doses in the last trimester of pregnancy or during labour can cause irregularities in the \nheartbeat of the unborn child, and hypothermia, hypotonia, mild respiratory depression and poor feeding in \nthe neonate. It should be borne in mind that both pregnancy itself and abrupt discontinuation of the \nmedication can cause exacerbation of epilepsy. Since Clonatril passes into the breast milk, it must not be \ntaken during breast-feeding. If there is a compelling indication for Clonatril, breast-feeding should be \ndiscontinued.  \nInteractions\nClonatril can be administered concurrently with one or more antiepileptic agents. But adding an extra \nmedicine to the patients regimen should involve a careful evaluation of the response to the treatment, \nbecause unwanted effects, such as sedation and apathy are more likely to occur. In such cases, the dosage of \neach medicine must be adjusted to achieve the optimum desired effect. Concurrent administration of liver \nenzyme inducers such as barbiturates, hydantoins or carbamazepine, may accelerate the biotransformation of \nclonazepam without affecting its protein binding. By contrast, clonazepam itself does not appear to induce the enzymes responsible for its own metabolism.\nIn concurrent treatment with phenytoin or primidone, a rise in the serum concentration of these two \nsubstances has occasionally been observed. The combination of clonazepam with valproic acid may \noccasionally cause petit mal status epilepticus. Concurrent use of Clonatril\n and other centrally acting \nmedications, e.g. other anticonvulsant (anti-epileptic) agents, anaesthetics, hypnotics, psychoactive medicines \nand some analgesics as well as muscle-relaxants, may result in mutual potentiation of the medicinal effects. \nThis is especially true in the presence of alcohol. In combination therapy with centrally acting medications, the \ndosage of each medicine must be adjusted to achieve the optimum effect. Epileptic patients being treated with \nClonatril must under no circumstances consume alcohol since it may alter the effect of the medicine, reduce \nthe efficacy of treatment or produce unexpected unwanted effects.\nOverdosage\nSymptoms: The symptoms of overdosage or intoxication vary greatly from person to person depending on age, \nbodyweight and individual response. They range from drowsiness and light-headedness to ataxia, somnolence \nand stupor, and finally to coma with respiratory depression and circulatory collapse. Serious sequelae are rare unless other medicines, drugs or alcohol have been taken concomitantly. Treatment: In the management of \noverdose it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been taken. In addition to monitoring of \nrespiration, pulse rate and blood pressure, gastric lavage, i.v. fluid replacement with general supportive \nmeasures and the provision of emergency facilities to deal with possible airways obstruction are indicated. \nHypotension may be treated with sympathomimetic agents. Warning: The benzodiazepine antagonist Anexate\n \n(active ingredient: flumazenil) is not indicated in patients with epilepsy who have been treated with \nbenzodiazepines. Antagonism of the benzodiazepine effect in such patients may provoke seizures.\nStability\nThis medicine should not be used after the expiry date (EXP) shown on the pack.\nPacks \nClonatril  0.5 mg Tablets: Each box contains 5x10s tablets in blister pack.\nClonatril  1 mg Tablets: Each box contains  3x10s tablets in blister pack.\nClonatril  2 mg Tablets: Each box contains  3x10s tablets in blister pack.\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30 º C.\nProtect from light.\n  Medicine: keep out of reach of children",

      "description": "Description\nCo-Disys\n is a fixed combination of amlodipine and \nvalsartan. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater \neffect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac \nmuscle cells. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial \nvasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth \nmuscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular \nresistance and reduction in blood pressure.\nValsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and \naldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by \nselectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the \nAT\n1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth \nmuscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. By blocking the action of angiotensin, valsartan dilates the blood vessels and reduces blood \npressure. Valsartan has much (about 20,000-fold) \ngreater affinity for the A T\n1 receptor than for the A T2 \nreceptor.",

Co-Disys\n may also be used as \ninitial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals.",
      "dosage": "Dosage and Administration\nAmlodipine is an effective treatment of hypertension in once daily doses of 2.5 mg to-10 mg while valsartan is \neffective in doses of 80 mg to-320 mg. The majority of \nthe antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy or a change in dose. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of 10 mg amlodipine and 320 mg \nvalsartan daily as needed to control blood pressure. \nCo-Disys\n may be administered with or without food. \nCo-Disys may be administered with other \nantihypertensive agents.\nElderly patients:  Because of decreased clearance of \namlodipine, therapy should usually be initiated at 2.5 mg.\nRenal impairment:  No initial dosage adjustment is \nrequired for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.

The use of Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy and contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. \nIt is not known whether amlodipine or valsartan are \nexcreted in human milk. In the absence of this \ninformation, it is recommended that nursing be \ndiscontinued while Co-Disys\n is administered.\nDrug Interactions\nInteraction linked to amlodipine:  A study in elderly \npatients has shown that diltiazem inhibits the metabolism of amlodipine, probably via CYP3A4 (plasma concentration increases by approximately 50 and the effect of amlodipine is increased). The possibility that more potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (i.e. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) may increase the plasma concentration of amlodipine to a greater extent than diltiazem cannot be excluded.

      "description": "Description\nCombicard is a fixed-dose combination of Amlodipine and \nAtenolol. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium \nantagonist that inhibits the transmembrane influx of \ncalcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac \nmuscle; it has a greater efffect on vascular smooth muscle \nthan on cardiac muscle. Amlodipine is a peripheral \nvasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to \ncause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and \nreduction in blood pressure. Amlodipine reduces tone, \ndecreases coronary vasoreactivity and lowers cardiac \ndemand by reducing after load. Atenolol is a cardio-\nselective beta-blocker. The cardio-selectivity is dose-\nrelated. Atenolol causes a reduction in blood pressure by \nlowering cardiac output, decreasing the plasma renin \nactivity and sympathetic outflow from CNS. Atenolol also \ncauses a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand by virtue \nof its negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects.",

      "description": "Description: Combiver inhaler is a \npressurized metered dose inhaler. It is \nintended for oral inhalations only. It is a \ncombination of Salbutamol BP and \nIpratropium Bromide BP. Salbutamol, a short \nacting ß2-agonist bronchodilator and \nIpratropium Bromide, an anticholinergic \nbronchodilator produce greater \nbronchodilator effect when used in \ncombination than either agent alone. This \ncombination is expected to maximize the response to treatment in patients with \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n(COPD) by reducing bronchospasm through \ntwo distinctly different mechanisms, \nanticholinergic (parasympatholytic) and \nsympathomimetic.\nIndication: Combiver inhaler is indicated \nas a bronchodilator for the treatment of \nbronchospasm associated with chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in \npatients who require regular treatment with \nboth Salbutamol and Ipratropium. It is also \nuseful in patients having asthma featuring \nCOPD symptoms & in patients having history \nof smoking over 10 pack - years.\nDosage and Administration: The dosage \nof Combiver inhaler should be \nindividualized according to the requirement \nof patient.\nAdults (including elderly and adolescents 12 \nyears of age): 2 inhalations (puffs) four times \na day. Additional inhalations (puffs) may be \ntaken if required; however, maximum number \nof inhalations (puffs) should not exceed 12 \ninhalations (puffs) in 24 hours. Children and \nPediatric patients: Safety and effectiveness of patients below 12 years of age have not been \nestablished.\nUse in hepatic or renal disease: This \ncombination has not been studied in patients \nwith hepatic or renal insufﬁciency. It should \nbe used with caution in those patients. \nContraindication: This combination \ninhalation aerosol is contraindicated in \npatients with a history of hypersensitivity to \nany of the ingredients. It is contraindicated in \npatients with hypertrophic obstructive \ncardiomyopathy or tachyarrhythmia, and in \npatients hypersensitive to any components of \nthe product or to atropine or its derivatives. It \nis also contraindicated in patients with a \nhistory of hypersensitivity to soya lecithin or \nrelated food products such as soyabean and \npeanut.\nWarning and Precaution: As this \npreparation contains Ipratropium Bromide \nand, therefore, caution should be exercised \nin patients having narrow-angle glaucoma, \nprostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck \nobstruction. Since this preparation also \ncontains sympathomimetic amines such as \nSalbutamol Sulphate, therefore, caution should be taken in patients having \nconvulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or \ndiabetes mellitus and in patients who are \nunusually responsive to sympathomimetic \namines. Signiﬁcant hypokalaemia may also \nbe produced by ß adrenergic agents \n(possibly through intracellular shunting) in \nsome patients which has the potential to \nproduce adverse cardiovascular effects. This \nhypokalaemia is usually transient, not \nrequiring supplementation.\nParadoxical bronchospasm: This inhalation \naerosol can produce paradoxical \nbronchospasm that can be life threatening. If \nit occurs, immediate discontinuation of the \npreparation is advised and alternative \ntherapy should be instituted. It should be \nrecognized that paradoxical bronchospasm, \nwhen associated with inhaled formulations, \nfrequently occurs with the ﬁrst use of a new \ncanister.\nCardiovascular effect: Like other ß adrenergic \nagonists, Salbutamol Sulphate can produce a \nclinically signiﬁcant cardiovascular effect in \nsome patients, as measured by pulse rate, \nblood pressure andor other symptoms. Although such effects are uncommon after \nadministration of this inhalation aerosol at \nrecommended doses, if they occur, the \npreparation may be discontinued. In addition, \nß adrenergic agents have been reported to \nproduce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, \nsuch as ﬂattening of the T wave, \nprolongation of the QTC interval, and ST \nsegment depression. Therefore, caution \nshould be exercised in patients with \ncardiovascular disorders, especially coronary \ninsufﬁciency, cardiac arrhythmia and \nhypertension.\nImmediate hypersensitivity reactions: \nImmediate hypersensitivity reactions may \noccur after administration of Ipratropium \nBromide or Salbutamol Sulphate, as \ndemonstrated by rare cases of urticaria, \nangio-oedema, rash, bronchospasm, \nanaphylaxis and oropharyngeal oedema. \nAdverse Reaction: As the combination \ninhaler contains Salbutamol and Ipratropium \nBromide, the type and severity of adverse \nreactions associated with each of the \ncompounds may be expected. The following \nadverse events may be observed: Salbutamol: There have been rare reports of mild tremor \nand headache. These usually disappear with \ncontinuous treatment. Transient muscle \ncramp has been reported very rarely. There \nhave been very rare reports of \nhypersensitivity reactions such as \nangio-oedema, urticaria, bronchospasm, \nhypotension and collapse. Ipratropium: There \nhave been reports of headache, pain, \ninﬂuenza, coughing, pneumonia, chest pain, \nnausea, bronchitis, dyspnea, and \nbronchospasm in lower part, and pharyngitis, \nsinusitis and rhinitis in the upper part. \nPregnancy and Lactations: This \ncombination (Salbutamol Sulphate and \nIpratropium Bromide) inhalation aerosol is \npregnancy Category C.\nIpratropium: Pregnancy Category B. Animal \nstudies have demonstrated no evidence of \nteratogenic effects as a result of Ipratropium \nbromide.\nSalbutamol: Pregnancy Category C. \nSalbutamol has been shown to be \nteratogenic in mice. There are, however, no \nadequate and well controlled studies of this \ninhalation aerosol of Ipratropium bromide or Salbutamol Sulphate in pregnant women. \nBecause animal reproduction studies are not \nalways predictive of human response, this \ninhalation aerosol should be used during \npregnancy only if the potential beneﬁt \njustiﬁes the potential risk to the foetus. It is \nnot known whether the components of this \ninhalation aerosol are excreted in human \nmilk. This inhalation aerosol should be used \nin lactating mother only if the potential \nbeneﬁt justiﬁes the potential risk to the \nneonate.\nDrug interaction: This inhalation aerosol \nhas been used concomitantly with other \ndrugs, including sympathomimetic \nbronchodilators, methylxanthines and \nsteroids, commonly used in the treatment of \nCOPD, without adverse drug reactions.\nAnticholinergic agents: Caution is advised in \nthe co-administration of this inhalation \naerosol with other anticholinergic drugs, as \nthere is potential for an additive interaction.\nBeta-adrenergic agents: There is an \nincreased risk of adverse cardiovascular \neffects. Caution is therefore, advised in the \nco-administration of this inhalation aerosol and other sympathomimetic agents. \nß-receptor blocking agents and Salbutamol \ninhibit the effect of each other. ß-receptor \nblocking agents should be used cautiously in \npatients with hyperreactive airways.\nDiuretics: Caution is advised in the \nco-administration of ß agonist containing \ndrugs with non-potassium sparing diuretics. \nß-adrenergic agonists should be \nadministered with extreme caution in \npatients being treated with monoamine \noxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants \nor within two weeks of discontinuation of \nsuch agents because the action of \nß-adrenergic agonists may be enhanced.\nOverdose: The effects of overdosage are \nexpected to be related primarily to \nSalbutamol. Acute overdosage with \nipratropium bromide by inhalation is unlikely \nsince ipratropium bromide is not well \nabsorbed systemically after aerosol or oral \nadministration. Manifestations of overdosage \nwith Salbutamol may include anginal pain, \nhypertension, hypokalemia, and tachycardia \nwith rates up to 200 beats per minute. As \nwith all sympathomimetic aerosol medications, cardiac arrest and even death \nmay be associated with abuse. Dialysis is not \nappropriate treatment for overdosage of \nsalbutamol as an inhalation aerosol; the \njudicious use of a cardiovascular ß-receptor \nblocker, such as metoprolol tartrate may be \nindicated.\nPharmaceutical Precaution: Pressurized \ncanister, do not puncture, break or incinerate \neven when apparently empty. Avoid storage \nin direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30 ºC. \nKeep away from eyes. Keep away from \nchildren.\nCommercial Pack: Combiver inhaler is \navailable in 200 metered dose pack, each \nmetered actuation containing 100 microgram \nof Salbutamol (as Salbutamol Sulphate BP) \nand Ipratropium Bromide BP 20 microgram.\nManufactured by\nHealthcare Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\nRajendrapur, Gazipur, BangladeshßrJVLPhr jq fgq AjPyuJPrr IÄv xoNy FuPTJyu oMÜ ToKmnJrKxFlKx oMÜ ToKmnJr\nToKmnJr AjPyuJrKa KxFlKx oMÜ AjPyuJrÇ \nKxFlKx kPkuqJ pJ IJPV mqmyJr TrJ yPfJ fJ \nFUj kKrPmv mJºm KxFlKx oMÜ kPkuqJ, \nFAYFlF KhP kKfJkj TrJ yPPZÇ\nKYPr of ftjL S mMPzJ IJñMMPur oPiq\nAjPyuJrKa irPf yPmÇ\nCombiver Inhaler is a CFC free inhaler. \nThe CFC propellant that once used in \ninhaler has now been substituted with a \nmore environment friendly non-CFC \npropellant, HFA (Hydroﬂuroalkane).\nHold the inhaler as shown between index \nﬁnger and thumb.Combiver inhaler is an alcohol free \ninhaler.

Acute overdosage with \nipratropium bromide by inhalation is unlikely \nsince ipratropium bromide is not well \nabsorbed systemically after aerosol or oral \nadministration. Manifestations of overdosage \nwith Salbutamol may include anginal pain, \nhypertension, hypokalemia, and tachycardia \nwith rates up to 200 beats per minute. As \nwith all sympathomimetic aerosol medications, cardiac arrest and even death \nmay be associated with abuse. Dialysis is not \nappropriate treatment for overdosage of \nsalbutamol as an inhalation aerosol; the \njudicious use of a cardiovascular ß-receptor \nblocker, such as metoprolol tartrate may be \nindicated.\nPharmaceutical Precaution: Pressurized \ncanister, do not puncture, break or incinerate \neven when apparently empty. Avoid storage \nin direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30 ºC. \nKeep away from eyes.

Intrathecal administration of \nCytarabine Injection (preservative free preparations only) is indicated \nin the prophylaxis and treatment of meningeal leukemia.\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\nCytarabine Injection is not active orally. The schedule and method of \nadministration varies with the program of therapy to be used. \nCytarabine Injection may be given by intravenous infusion or \ninjection, subcutaneously, or intrathecally (preservative free \npreparation only). In the induction therapy of acute non-lymphocytic \nleukemia, the usual cytarabine dose in combination with other \nanticancer drugs is 100 mgm2day by continuous IV infusion (1 to 7 \nDays) or 100 mgm2 IV every 12 hours  1 to 7 Days). The literature \nshould be consulted for the current recommendations for use in \nacute lymphocytic leukemia.\nIntrathecal Use in Meningeal Leukemia: Cytarabine injection has \nbeen used intrathecally in acute leukemia in doses ranging from 5 \nmgm2 to 75 mgm2 of body surface area.",

      "dosage": "dosage modifications in the table below have been used.\nThe data available for patients with severely impaired kidney \nfunction (creatinine clearance below 15 mlmin) are too \nlimited to permit a recommendation for treatment.\nThese dosing recommendations apply to the initial course of \ntreatment. Subsequent dosages should be adjusted according \nto the patients tolerance based on the degree of bone marrow \nsuppression. \nFormula dosing\nAnother approach for determining the initial dose of \ncarboplatin is the use of mathematical formula, which are \nbased on a patients pre-existing renal function or renal \nfunction and desired platelet nadir. Renal excretion is the \nmajor route of elimination for carboplatin. The use of dosing \nformula, as compared to empirical dose calculation based on \nbody surface area, allows compensation for patient variations \nin pretreatment renal function that might otherwise result in \neither underdosing (in patients with above average renal \nfunction) or overdosing (in patients with impaired renal function). A simple formula for calculating dosage, based \nupon a patients glomerular filtration rate (GFR in mlmin) and \ncarboplatin target area under the concentration versus time \ncurve (AUC in mgmLmin), has been proposed by Calvert. In \nthese studies, GFR was measured by 51Cr-EDTA clearance.\nThe target AUC of 4 mgmlmin to 6 mgmlmin using \nsingle-agent carboplatin appears to provide the most \nappropriate dose range in previously treated patients. This \nstudy also showed a trend between the AUC of single-agent \ncarboplatin administered to previously treated patients and the \nlikelihood of developing toxicity.Geriatric DosingBecause renal function is often decreased in elderly patients, \nformula dosing of carboplatin based on estimates of GFR \nshould be used in elderly patients to provide predictable \nplasma carboplatin AUCs and thereby minimize the risk of \ntoxicity.\nPreparation of intravenous solutions  \nCarboplatin Injection is a premixed aqueous solution of 10 mgml carboplatin. Carboplatin aqueous solution can be \nfurther diluted to concentrations as low as 0.5 mgml with 5 \nDextrose in Water (D5W) or 0.9 Sodium Chloride Injection, \nUSP. When prepared as directed, carboplatin aqueous \nsolutions are stable for 8 hours at room temperature (25C). \nSince no antibacterial preservative is contained in the \nformulation, it is recommended that carboplatin aqueous \nsolutions be discarded 8 hours after dilution.\nStorage \nStore at temperature not exceeding 25\n º C in a dry place. \nProtect from light.

Because thrombin (serine \nprotease) enables the conversion of fibrinogen into \nfibrin during the coagulation cascade, its inhibition \nprevents the development of a thrombus. Both free and \nclot-bound thrombin, and thrombin-induced platelet \naggregation are inhibited by the active moieties.\nIndications\nDabiran is a direct thrombin inhibitor indicated: \n To reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in \npatients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation\n For the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) \nand pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients who have \nbeen treated with a parenteral anticoagulant for 5-10 \ndays\n To reduce the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE in \npatients who have been previously treated\n For the prophylaxis of DVT and PE in patients who \nhave undergone hip replacement surgery\nDosage & Administration\n Reduction in the risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism \nin Patients with Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation:  \no For patients with CrCl 30 mLmin: 150 mg orally,          \ntwice daily\no For patients with CrCl 15-30 mLmin: 75 mg orally, \ntwice daily\n Treatment of DVT and PE: \no For patients with CrCl 30 mLmin: 150 mg orally, \ntwice daily after 5-10 days of parenteral \nanticoagulation\n Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE: \no For patients with CrCl 30 mLmin: 150 mg orally, \ntwice daily after previous treatment \n Prophylaxis of DVT and PE Following Hip    \nReplacement Surgery: \no For patients with CrCl 30 mLmin: 110 mg orally \nfirst day, then 220 mg once daily \n Temporarily discontinue Dabiran before invasive or \nsurgical procedures when possible, then restart \npromptly .\nContraindications\nDabigatran Etexilate is contraindicated in patients with \nactive pathological bleeding, patients with history of \nserious hypersensitivity reaction to Dabigatran Etexilate \nand patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valve.\nWarnings and Precautions\nPremature discontinuation of Dabigatran Etexilate \nincreases the risk of thrombotic events. Dabigatran \nEtexilate increases the risk of bleeding and can cause \nsignificant and, sometimes, fatal bleeding. Epidural or \nspinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with \nDabigatran Etexilate who are receiving neuraxial \nanesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These \nhematomas may result in long-term or permanent \nparalysis. The use of Dabigatran Etexilate is \ncontraindicated in patients with mechanical prosthetic \nvalves. The concomitant use of Dabigatran Etexilate \nwith P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin) reduces exposure to \ndabigatran and should generally be avoided. For \npatients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome, \ntreatment with Dabigatran Etexilate increases the risk \nof thrombosis.Side Effects\nPremature discontinuation of Dabigatran Etexilate \nincreases the risk of thrombotic events. Dabigatran \nEtexilate increases the risk of bleeding and can cause \nsignificant and, sometimes, fatal bleeding.

      "composition": "COMPOSITION\nDanib Tablet 100 mg: Each ﬁlm coated tablet contains Dasatinib INN 100 mg.\nPHARMACOLOGY\nDasatinib, at nano molar concentrations, inhibits the following kinases: BCR-ABL, SRC \nfamily (SRC, LCK, YES, FYN), c-KIT, EPHA2 and PDGFRB. Based on modeling studies, \nDasatinib is predicted to bind to multiple conformations of the ABL kinase. In vitro, Dasatinib was active in leukemic cell lines representing variants of Imatinib Mesylate sensitive and resistant disease. Dasatinib inhibits the growth of chronic myeloid \nleukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines overexpressing \nBCR-ABL. Under the conditions of the assays, Dasatinib was able to overcome Imatinib \nresistance resulting from BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, activation of alternate signaling pathways involving the SRC family kinases (LYN, HCK) and multi-drug resistance gene over expression.\nPHARMACOKINETICS\nAbsorption\nMaximum plasma concentrations (C\nmax) of Dasatinib are observed between 0.5 and 6 \nhours (T max) following oral administration. Dasatinib exhibits dose proportional \nincreases in AUC and linear elimination characteristics over the dose range of 15 mg \nto 240 mgday. The overall mean terminal half-life of Dasatinib is 3 to 5 hours.\nDistribution\nIn patients, Dasatinib has an apparent volume of distribution of 2505 L, suggesting that the drug is extensively distributed in the extravascular space. Binding of Dasatinib and its active metabolite to human plasma proteins in vitro was approximately 96 and 93 respectively, with no concentration dependence over the range of 100 to 500 \nngmL.\nMetabolism\nDasatinib is extensively metabolized in humans, primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme 3A4. CYP3A4 was the primary enzyme responsible for the formation of the active metabolite. Flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO-3) and uridine \ndiphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes are also involved in the \nformation of Dasatinib metabolites.\nElimination\nElimination is primarily via the feces. Following a single oral dose of \n14C-labeled \nDasatinib, approximately 4 and 85 of the administered radioactivity was recovered \nin the urine and feces respectively, within 10 days. Unchanged Dasatinib accounted for \n0.1 and 19 of the administered dose in urine and feces, respectively, with the \nremainder of the dose being metabolites.\nINDICATIONS\nDasatinib is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of:\n Newly diagnosed adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph) chronic \nmyeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase.\n  Adults with chronic, accelerated or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase Ph CML with \nresistance or intolerance to prior therapy including Imatinib.\n  Adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph \nALL) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\nThe recommended starting dose of Dasatinib for chronic phase CML is 100 mg \nadministered orally once daily. The recommended starting dose of Dasatinib for accelerated phase CML, myeloid or lymphoid blast phase CML or Ph ALL is 140 mg \nadministered orally once daily.\nMethod of Administration\nTablets should not be crushed or cut; they should be swallowed whole. Dasatinib can \nbe taken with or without a meal, either in the morning or in the evening.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\nMyelosuppression\nTreatment with Dasatinib is associated with severe (NCI CTC Grade 3 or 4) \nthrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anemia. Their occurrence is more frequent in \npatients with advanced phase CML or Ph ALL than in chronic phase CML.\nBleeding Related Events\nIn addition to causing thrombocytopenia in human subjects, Dasatinib caused platelet \ndysfunction in vitro.\nFluid Retention\nDasatinib is associated with ﬂuid retention. In clinical trials, severe ﬂuid retention was \nreported in up to 10 of patients.\nQT Prolongation\nUse Dasatinib with caution in patients who have or may develop prolongation of the \nQT interval.\nPulmonary Arterial Hypertension\nDasatinib may increase the risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) \nwhich may occur any time after initiation including after more than one year of \ntreatment.\nEmbryo-fetal Toxicity\nDasatinib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Adverse fetal and infant outcomes have been reported from women who have taken Dasatinib.SIDE EFFECTS\nThe most common side effects are bloody or black tarry stools, body aches or pain, \nburning, tingling, numbness or pain in the hands, arms, feet or legs, chest pain, \nconstipation, cough or hoarseness, difﬁculty with breathing, dizziness, ear congestion, \nfainting, fast-slow or irregular heartbeat, fever or chills, full or bloated feeling, headache, loss of voice, lower back or side pain, painful or difﬁcult urination.\nUSE IN PREGNANCY AND LACTATION\nUS FDA approved pregnancy category D\nBased on limited human data, Dasatinib can cause fetal harm when administered to a \npregnant woman. Adverse pharmacologic effects including hydrops fetalis, fetal leukopenia, and fetal thrombocytopenia have been reported with maternal exposure to Dasatinib.\nNo data are available regarding the presence of Dasatinib in human milk, the effects \nof the drug on the breastfed child, or the effects of the drug on milk production. \nBreastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Dasatinib  and for 2 weeks after the ﬁnal dose\nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATION\n Nursing Mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration the \nimportance of the drug to the mother.\n  Hepatic Impairment: Use Dasatinib with caution in patients with hepatic impairment.\nUSE IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTChildren: The safety and effectiveness of Dasatinib monotherapy have been \ndemonstrated in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase Ph \nCMLPhALL. There are no data available for children under 1 year of age. Adverse \nreactions associated with bone growth and development and grade 1 osteopenia was \nreported\nAdults: While the safety proﬁle of Dasatinib in the geriatric population was similar to \nthat in the younger population, patients aged 65 years and older are more likely to \nexperience the commonly reported adverse reactions of fatigue, pleural effusion, \ndiarrhea, dyspnea, cough, lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and appetite \ndisturbance, and more likely to experience the less frequently reported adverse reactions of abdominal distention, dizziness, pericardial effusion, congestive heart \nfailure, hypertension, pulmonary edema, and weight decrease, and should be \nmonitored closely.\nDRUG INTERACTIONS\n CYP3A4 Inhibitors: May increase Dasatinib drug levels and should be avoided. If \ncoadministration cannot be avoided, monitor closely and consider reducing \nDasatinib dose.\n  CYP3A4 Inducers: May decrease Dasatinib drug levels. If coadministration cannot \nbe avoided, consider increasing Dasatinib dose.\n  Antacids: May decrease Dasatinib drug levels. Avoid simultaneous administration. If \nneeded, administer the antacid at least 2 hours prior to or 2 hours after the dose of Dasatinib.\n  H2 AntagonistsProton Pump Inhibitors: May decrease Dasatinib drug levels. \nConsider antacids in place of H 2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors.\nOVERDOSAGEThe highest overdose of 280 mg per day for 1 week was reported in two patients and \nboth developed severe myelosuppression and bleeding. \nSTORAGE\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30\nOC in a dry place.

Adverse pharmacologic effects including hydrops fetalis, fetal leukopenia, and fetal thrombocytopenia have been reported with maternal exposure to Dasatinib.\nNo data are available regarding the presence of Dasatinib in human milk, the effects \nof the drug on the breastfed child, or the effects of the drug on milk production. \nBreastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Dasatinib  and for 2 weeks after the ﬁnal dose\nUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATION\n Nursing Mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration the \nimportance of the drug to the mother.\n  Hepatic Impairment: Use Dasatinib with caution in patients with hepatic impairment.\nUSE IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTChildren: The safety and effectiveness of Dasatinib monotherapy have been \ndemonstrated in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase Ph \nCMLPhALL. There are no data available for children under 1 year of age. Adverse \nreactions associated with bone growth and development and grade 1 osteopenia was \nreported\nAdults: While the safety proﬁle of Dasatinib in the geriatric population was similar to \nthat in the younger population, patients aged 65 years and older are more likely to \nexperience the commonly reported adverse reactions of fatigue, pleural effusion, \ndiarrhea, dyspnea, cough, lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and appetite \ndisturbance, and more likely to experience the less frequently reported adverse reactions of abdominal distention, dizziness, pericardial effusion, congestive heart \nfailure, hypertension, pulmonary edema, and weight decrease, and should be \nmonitored closely.",

      "composition": "Composition\nDaunobin for Injection 20 mg: Each vial contains Daunorubicin Hydrochloride USP 21.40 mg eqivalent to Daunorubicin 20 mg.    \nPharmacology\nDaunorubicin has antimitotic and cytotoxic activity through a number of proposed mechanisms of action. Daunorubicin forms complexes with DNA by intercalation between base pairs. It inhibits topoisomerase II activity by stabilizing the \nDNA-topoisomerase II complex, preventing the religation \nportion of the ligation-religation reaction that topoisomerase II \ncatalyzes. Single strand and double strand DNA breaks result. Daunorubicin hydrochloride may also inhibit polymerase activity, affect regulation of gene expression, and produce free \nradical damage to DNA. Daunorubicin hydrochloride possesses \nan antitumor effect against a wide spectrum of animal tumors, either grafted or spontaneous.\nIndications\nDaunorubicin hydrochloride in combination with other \napproved anticancer drugs is indicated for remission induction \nin acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (myelogenous, monocytic, erythroid) of adults and for remission induction in acute lymphocytic leukemia of children and adults.\nDosage and Administration\nRepresentative Dose Schedules and Combination for the \nApproved Indication of Remission Induction in Adult Acute \nNonlymphocytic Leukemia. In Combination: For patients under age 60, daunorubicin hydrochloride 45 mgm\n2 day IV on days 1, 2, and 3 of the first \ncourse and on days 1, 2 of subsequent courses and cytosine \narabinoside 100 mgm2 day IV infusion daily for 7 days for the \nfirst course and for 5 days for subsequent courses. For patients \n60 years of age and above, daunorubicin hydrochloride 30 \nmgm2 day IV on days 1, 2, and 3 of the first course and on days \n1, 2 of subsequent courses and cytosine arabinoside 100 mgm2 \nday IV infusion daily for 7 days for the first course and for 5 \ndays for subsequent courses. \nContraindications\nDaunorubicin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients who \nhave shown a hypersensitivity to it.\nWarnings \nBone Marrow: Daunorubicin hydrochloride is a potent bone \nmarrow suppressant. Suppression will occur in all patients \ngiven a therapeutic dose of this drug. Therapy with daunorubicin hydrochloride should not be started in patients with pre-existing drug-induced bone marrow suppression \nunless the benefit from such treatment warrants the risk. \nPersistent, severe myelosuppression may result in \nsuperinfection or hemorrhage.Cardiac Effects: Special attention must be given to the potential cardiac toxicity of daunorubicin hydrochloride, \nparticularly in infants and children. Pre-existing heart disease \nand previous therapy with doxorubicin are co-factors of \nincreased risk of daunorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity and the \nbenefit-to-risk ratio of daunorubicin hydrochloride therapy in such patients should be weighted before starting daunorubicin \nhydrochloride. In adults, at total cumulative doses less than 550 \nmgm\n2 , acute congestive heart failure is seldom encountered. \nHowever, rare instances of pericarditis-myocarditis, not \ndose-related, have been reported.\nEvaluation of Hepatic and Renal Function: Significant hepatic or \nrenal impairment can enhance the toxicity of the recommended \ndoses of daunorubicin hydrochloride; therefore, prior to administration, evaluation of hepatic function and renal function \nusing conventional clinical laboratory tests is recommended.\nPregnancy: Pregnancy Category D. Daunorubicin \nhydrochloride may cause fetal harm when administered to a \npregnant woman. An increased incidence of fetal abnormalities \n(parieto-occipital cranioschisis, umbilical hernias, or Daunorubicin USP 20 mg\nrachischisis) and abortions was reported in rabbits at doses of \n0.05 mgkgday or approximately 1100th of the highest \nrecommended human dose on a body surface area basis. Rats \nshowed an increased incidence of esophageal, cardiovascular \nand urogenital abnormalities as well as rib fusions at doses of \n4 mgkgday or approximately ½ the human dose on a body surface area basis. Decreases in fetal birth weight and post-delivery growth rate were observed in mice. There are no \nadequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If \nthis drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes \npregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. \nSecondary Leukemias: There have been reports of secondary \nleukemias in patients exposed to topoisomerase II inhibitors \nwhen used in combination with other antineoplastic agents or radiation therapy. Extravasation at Injection Site: Extravasation of daunorubicin \nhydrochloride at the site of intravenous administration can \ncause severe local tissue necrosis\nSide Effects\nCommon: Reversible alopecia occurs in most patients. Rash, contact dermatitis and urticaria have occurred rarely. Acute nausea and vomiting occur but are usually mild. Antiemetic \ntherapy may be of some help. Mucositis may occur 3 to 7 days \nafter administration. Diarrhea and abdominal pain have occasionally been reported. If extravasation occurs during administration, severe local tissue necrosis, severe cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, or painful induration can result.\nRare: Anaphylactoid reaction, fever, and chills can occur. \nHyperuricemia may occur, especially in patients with leukemia, and serum uric acid levels should be monitored. \nNursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is \nexcreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in \nhuman milk and because of the potential for serious adverse \nreactions in nursing infants from daunorubicin, mothers should be advised to discontinue nursing during daunorubicin therapy. Drug Interactions: Use of daunorubicin in a patient who has \npreviously received doxorubicin increases the risk of \ncardiotoxicity. Daunorubicin hydrochloride should not be used in patients who have previously received the recommended maximum cumulative doses of doxorubicin or daunorubicin hydrochloride. Cyclophosphamide used concurrently with \ndaunorubicin hydrochloride may also result in increased \ncardiotoxicity. Dosage reduction of daunorubicin hydrochloride \nmay be required when used concurrently with other myelosuppressive agents. Hepatotoxic medications, such as high-dose methotrexate, may impair liver function and increase \nthe risk of toxicity.\nOverdose: There is nospecific antidote need to consult doctor \nimmediately if overdose occur.\nStorage: Store at temperature not exceeding 25º C in a dry \nplace. Protect from light and moisture.\nPackaging: Daunobin for Injection 20 mg: Each box \ncontaining 1 vial in plastic tray.Daunobin\n13002150\nSize : 6.5 x 10.25_ Abida\n- C0, M14, Y20, K0 _Colour",

Decreases in fetal birth weight and post-delivery growth rate were observed in mice. There are no \nadequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. If \nthis drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes \npregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. \nSecondary Leukemias: There have been reports of secondary \nleukemias in patients exposed to topoisomerase II inhibitors \nwhen used in combination with other antineoplastic agents or radiation therapy. Extravasation at Injection Site: Extravasation of daunorubicin \nhydrochloride at the site of intravenous administration can \ncause severe local tissue necrosis",
      "drug_interactions": "Drug Interactions: Use of daunorubicin in a patient who has \npreviously received doxorubicin increases the risk of \ncardiotoxicity. Daunorubicin hydrochloride should not be used in patients who have previously received the recommended maximum cumulative doses of doxorubicin or daunorubicin hydrochloride. Cyclophosphamide used concurrently with \ndaunorubicin hydrochloride may also result in increased \ncardiotoxicity. Dosage reduction of daunorubicin hydrochloride \nmay be required when used concurrently with other myelosuppressive agents. Hepatotoxic medications, such as high-dose methotrexate, may impair liver function and increase \nthe risk of toxicity.",

      "indications": "indications, Warnings etc.\nContra-indications: Trihexyphenidyl HCI is contra-indicated in patients \nwith hypersensitivity to Trihexyphenidyl HCI. Trihexyphenidyl HCI is also \ncontra-indicated in patients with narrow angle glaucoma. Blindness \nafter long-term use due to narrow angle glaucoma has been reported. \nPrecautions: Patients to be treated with Trihexyphenidyl HCI should \nhave a gonioscope evaluation prior to initiation of therapy and close \nmonitoring of intraocular pressures. The use of anticholinergic drugs \nmay precipitate angle closure with an increase in intraocular pressure. If blurring of vision occurs during therapy, the possibility of narrow angle \nglaucoma should be considered. Blindness has been reported due to \naggravation of narrow angle glaucoma. Trihexyphenidyl HCI should be \nadministered with caution in hot weather, especially when given \nconcomitantly with other atropine-like drugs to the chronically ill, \nalcoholics, those who have central nervous system disease, or those \nwho do manual labor in a hot environment. Anhidrosis may occur more \nreadily when some disturbance of sweating already exists. If there is evidence of anhidrosis, the possibility of hyperthermia should be \nconsidered.",
      "dosage": "Dosage and Administration\nDosage should be individualized. The initial dose should be low and \nthen increased gradually, especially in patients over 60 years of age. \nWhether Trihexyphenidyl HCI may best be given before or after meals \nshould be determined by the way the patient reacts. Postencephalitic \npatients, who are usually more prone to excessive salivation, may prefer \nto take it after meals and may, in addition, require small amounts of \natropine which, under such circumstances, is sometimes an effective \nadjuvant. If Trihexyphenidyl HCI tends to dry the mouth excessively, it \nmay be better to take it before meals, unless it causes nausea. If taken \nafter meals, the thirst sometimes induced can be allayed by mint \ncandies, chewing gum or water.\nAbrupt withdrawal of treatment for Parkinsonism may result in acute \nexacerbation of Parkinsonism symptoms; therefore, abrupt withdrawal \nshould be avoided.\nAbrupt withdrawal of treatment may result in neuroleptic malignant \nsyndrome (NMS).\nIdiopathic Parkinsonism: As initial therapy for parkinsonism, 1 mg of \nTrihexyphenidyl HCI tablet form may be administered the first day. The \ndose may then be increased by 2 mg increments at intervals of three to \nfive days, until a total of 6 to 10 mg is given daily. The total daily dose \nwill depend upon what is found to be the optimal level. Many patients derive maximum benefit from this daily total of 6 to 10 mg, but some \npatients, chiefly those in the postencephalitic group, may require a total \ndaily dose of 12 to 15 mg.Drug-Induced Parkinsonism: The size and frequency of the Delpark\n \n(Trihexyphenidyl HCI) dose needed to control extrapyramidal reactions \nto commonly employed tranquilizers, notably the phenothiazines, \nthioxanthenes, and butyrophenones, must be determined empirically. The total daily dosage usually ranges between 5 and 15 mg although, in \nsome cases, these reactions have been satisfactorily controlled with as \nlittle as 1 mg daily. It may be advisable to commence therapy with a \nsingle 1mg dose. If the extrapyramidal manifestations are not controlled \nin a few hours, the subsequent doses may be progressively increased \nuntil satisfactory_ control is achieved. Satisfactory control may \nsometimes be more rapidly achieved by temporarily reducing the \ndosage of the tranquilizer when instituting Delpark\n (Trihexyphenidyl \nHCI) therapy and then adjusting the dosage of both drugs until the \ndesired ataractic effect is retained without onset of extrapyramidal \nreactions. It is sometimes possible to maintain the patient on a reduced \nDelpark (Trihexyphenidyl HCI) dosage after the reactions have \nremained under control for several days. Instances have been reported \nin which these reactions have remained in remission for long periods \nafter Delpark (Trihexyphenidyl HCI) therapy was discontinued.\nConcomitant use with Levodopa: When Delpark (Trihexyphenidyl HCI) \nis used concomitantly with levodopa, the usual dose of each may need \nto be reduced. Careful adjustment is necessary, depending on side \neffects and degree of symptom control. Trihexyphenidyl HCI dosage of 3 \nto 6mg daily, in divided doses, is usually adequate.\nConcomitant use with other Parasympathetic Inhibitors: Delpark \n(Trihexyphenidyl HCI) may be substituted, in whole or in part, for other parasympathetic inhibitors. The usual technique is partial substitution \ninitially, with progressive reduction in the other medication as the dose \nof Trihexyphenidyl HCI is increased.\nDelpark\n (Trihexyphenidyl HCI) Tablets - The total daily intake of \nDelpark (Trihexyphenidyl HCI) tablet is tolerated best if divided into 3 \ndoses and taken at mealtimes. High doses ( 10 mg daily) may be divided into 4 parts, with 3 doses administered at mealtimes and the \nfourth at bedtime.\nContra-indications,",
      "side_effects": "Side effects\nMinor side effects, such as dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, \ndizziness, mild nausea or nervousness, will be experienced by 30 to 50 \npercent of all patients. These sensations, however, are much less troublesome with Trihexyphenidyl HCI than with belladonna alkaloids \nand are usually less disturbing than unallenated parkinsonism. Such \nreactions tend to become less pronounced, and even to disappear, as \ntreatment continues. Even before these reactions have remitted \nspontaneously, they may often be controlled by careful adjustment of \ndosage form, amount of drug, or interval between doses. Isolated \ninstances of suppurative parotitis secondary to excessive dryness of the \nmouth, skin rashes, dilatation of the colon, paralytic ileus, and certain \npsychiatric manifestations such as delusions, hallucinations, and \nparanoia, all of which may occur with any of the atropine-like drugs, \nhave been reported rarely with Trihexyphenidyl HCI. Potential side \neffects associated with the use of any atropine-like drugs, including \nTrihexyphenidyl HCI, include cognitive dysfunctions, including confusion \nand memory impairment; constipation, drowsiness, urinary hesitancy or \nretention, tachycardia, dilation of the pupil, increased intraocular \npressure, choreiform movements, weakness, vomiting, and headache. \nExacerbation of parkinsonism with abrupt treatment withdrawal has \nbeen reported. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome with abrupt treatment \nwithdrawal has been reported. The occurrence of angle-closure glaucoma in patients receiving Trihexyphenidyl HCI has been reported \n(blindness has been reported in some cases). Paradoxical sinus \nbradycardia, dry skin, and cycloplegia have been reported. In addition to \nadverse events seen in adults, the following adverse events have been \nreported in the literature in pediatric patients: hyperkinesia, psychosis, \nforgetfulness, weight loss, restlessness, chorea, and sleep alterations.",

      "drug_interactions": "Drug interactions\nCannabinoids, barbiturates, opiates, and alcohol may have additive \neffects with Trihexyphenidyl HCI, and thus, an abuse potential exists. \nConcurrent use of alcohol or other CNS depressants with \nTrihexyphenidyl HCI may cause increased sedative effects. Monoamine \noxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants possessing significant \nanticholinergic activity may intensify the anticholinergic effects of \nantidyskinetic agents because of the secondary anticholinergic activities \nof these medications. Prophylactic administration of anticholinergic \nagents, such as Trihexyphenidyl HCI, as a prevention of drug-induced \nparkinsonism during neuroleptic therapy is not recommended. There may be an increased risk for the development of tardive dyskinesia \nduring concomitant administration of anticholinergics and neuroleptics. \nThe usual dose of either Trihexyphenidyl HCI or levodopa may need to \nbe reduced during concomitant therapy, since concomitant \nadministration may increase drug-induced involuntary movements.\nSide effects\nMinor side effects, such as dryness of the mouth, blurred vision, \ndizziness, mild nausea or nervousness, will be experienced by 30 to 50 \npercent of all patients. These sensations, however, are much less troublesome with Trihexyphenidyl HCI than with belladonna alkaloids \nand are usually less disturbing than unallenated parkinsonism.

      "composition": "Composition\nDentro Capsule 25 mg: Each capsule contains Dantrolene Sodium \n(Hydrate) USP 29.68 mg equivalent to Dantrolene Sodium 25 mg.\nDentro Capsule 50 mg: Each capsule contains Dantrolene Sodium \n(Hydrate) USP 59.36 mg equivalent to Dantrolene Sodium 50 mg.\nPharmacology\nDentro produces relaxation by affecting the contractile response of \nthe skeletal muscle at a site beyond the myoneural junction, directly \non the muscle itself. In skeletal muscle, Dentro dissociates the \nexcitation-contraction coupling, probably by interfering with the \nrelease of Ca from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\nIndications\nIn Chronic Spasticity:  Dentro is indicated in controlling the \nmanifestations of clinical spasticity resulting from upper motor \nneuronal disorders (e.g. spinal cord injury, stroke, cerebral palsy, or \nmultiple sclerosis). It is of particular benefit to the patients whose \nfunctional rehabilitation has been retarded by the sequelae of \nspasticity. Such patients must have presumably reversible spasticity \nwhere relief of spasticity will aid in restoring residual function.\nDentro is not indicated in the treatment of skeletal muscle spasm \nresulting from rheumatic disorders.\nOccasionally, subtle but meaningful improvement in spasticity may \noccur with Dentro therapy. In such instances, information regarding \nimprovement should be solicited from the patient.\nBrief withdrawal of Dentro for a period of 2 to 4 days will frequently \ndemonstrate exacerbation of the manifestations of spasticity and may \nserve to confirm a clinical impression. \nA decision to continue the administration of Dentro on a long-term \nbasis is justified if introduction of the drug into the patients regimen:\n-produces a significant reduction in painful andor disabling spasticity \nsuch as clonus, or\n-permits a significant reduction in the intensity andor degree of \nnursing care required, or\n-rids the patient of any annoying manifestation of spasticity \nconsidered important by the patient himself.\nIn Malignant Hyperthermia:  Oral Dentro is also indicated \npreoperatively to prevent or attenuate the development of signs of \nmalignant hyperthermia in known, or strongly suspect, malignant \nhyperthermia susceptible patients who require anesthesia andor \nsurgery. Oral Dentro should be administered following a malignant \nhyperthermic crisis to prevent recurrence of the signs of malignant \nhyperthermia.\nDosage and administration\nFor use in Chronic Spasticity: Adults:  The following gradual \ntitration schedule is suggested. Some patients will not respond until \nhigher daily dosage is achieved. Each dosage level should be \nmaintained for seven days to determine the patients response. If no \nfurther benefit is observed at the next higher dose, dosage should be \ndecreased to the previous lower dose.\nStarting dose is 25 mg twice per day and it can be increased to 25-50 \nmg per day per week. Maximum accepted dosage is 400 mg per day.\nPaediatric Patients:  The following gradual titration schedule is \nsuggested. Some patients will not respond until higher daily dosage is \nachieved. Each dosage level should be maintained for seven days to \ndetermine the patients response. If no further benefit is observed at \nthe next higher dose, dosage should be decreased to the previous \nlower dose.\n0.5 mgkg once daily for seven days, then 0.5 mgkg 3 times for 7 \ndays, 1 mgkg 3 times for 7 days, 2 mgkg 3 times a day, Therapy with \na dose 4 times daily may be necessary for some individuals.\nFor Malignant Hyperthermia\nPreoperatively: Administer 4 to 8 mgkgday of oral Dentro in 3 or \n4 divided doses for one or two days prior to surgery, with the last dose \nbeing given approximately 3 to 4 hours before scheduled surgery with \na minimum of water. \nPost Crisis Follow-up: Oral Dentro should also be administered \nfollowing a malignant hyperthermia crisis, in doses of 4 to 8 mgkg \nper day in four divided doses, for a one to three day period to prevent \nrecurrence of the manifestations of malignant hyperthermia.\nWarnings\nIn view of the potential for liver damage in long-term Dentro use, \ntherapy should be stopped if benefits are not evident within 45 days.\nInformation for Patients:  Patients should be cautioned against \ndriving a motor vehicle or participating in hazardous occupations \nwhile taking Dentro. Caution should be exercised in the concomitant \nadministration of tranquilizing agents. Dentro might possibly evoke \na photosensitivity reaction; patients should be cautioned about \nexposure to sunlight while taking it. It is important to recognize that \nfatal and non-fatal liver disorders of an idiosyncratic or hypersensitivity type may occur with Dentro therapy. At the start of \nDentro therapy, it is desirable to do liver function studies (SGOT, \nSGPT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin) for a baseline or to \nestablish whether there is pre-existing liver disease. Liver function \nstudies (e.g. SGOT or SGPT) should be performed at appropriate \nintervals during Dentro therapy. Some patients have revealed a \nreturn to normal laboratory values in the face of continued therapy \nwhile others have not. If symptoms compatible with hepatitis, \naccompanied by abnormalities in liver function tests or jaundice \nappear, Dentro should be discontinued. If caused by Dentro and \ndetected early, the abnormalities in liver function characteristically \nhave reverted to normal when the drug was discontinued. Dentro \ntherapy has been reinstituted in a few patients who have developed \nclinical and or laboratory evidence of hepatocellular injury. If such \nreinstitution of therapy is done, it should be attempted only in \npatients who clearly need Dentro and only after previous symptoms \nand laboratory abnormalities have cleared. The patient should be \nhospitalized and the drug should be restarted in very small and \ngradually increasing doses. Laboratory monitoring should be frequent \nand the drug should be withdrawn immediately if there is any \nindication of recurrent liver involvement. Dentro should be used \nwith particular caution in females and in patients over 35 years of age \nin view of apparent greater likelihood of drug-induced, potentially \nfatal, hepatocellular disease in these groups.\nContraindications\nActive hepatic disease, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis.\nPrecautions\nDentro should be used with caution in patients with impaired \npulmonary function, and in patients with severely impaired cardiac \nfunction due to myocardial disease. It should be used with caution in \npatients with a history of previous liver disease or dysfunction.\nSide Effects\nThe most frequently occurring side effects of Dentro have been \ndrowsiness, dizziness, weakness, general malaise, fatigue, and \ndiarrhea. These are generally transient, occurring early in treatment, \nand can often be obviated by beginning with a low dose and \nincreasing dosage gradually until an optimal regimen is established. \nDiarrhea may be severe and may necessitate temporary withdrawal of \nDentro therapy. If diarrhea recurs upon readministration of Dentro, \ntherapy should probably be withdrawn permanently.\nPregnancy: Pregnancy Category C: Dentro capsules should be \nused during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk to the fetus.\nNursing Mothers: Dentro should not be used in nursing mothers.\nUsage in Paediatric Patients: The long-term safety of Dentro in \npaediatric patients under the age of 5 years has not been established. \nBecause of the possibility that adverse effects of the drug could \nbecome apparent only after many years, a benefit-risk consideration \nof the long-term use of Dentro is particularly important in pediatric \npatients.\nDrug Interactions\nDrowsiness may occur with Dentro therapy, and the concomitant \nadministration of CNS depressants such as sedatives and \ntranquilizing agents may result in further drowsiness. \nHepatotoxicity has occurred more often in women over 35 years of \nage receiving concomitant estrogen therapy.\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding  25 oC in a dry place. Protect from light \n& moisture .\nPackaging\nDentro Capsule 25 mg: Each box contains 3x10s capsules in blister \nstrips.\nDentro Capsule 50 mg: Each box contains 3 x6s capsules in blister \nstrips.\n   Medicine: Keep out of reach of childrenDentro\nDantrolene Sodium USP\n13002313Manufactured by\nHealthcare Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\nGazariapara, Rajendrapur\nGazipur-1703, Bangladesh\nDcvvb\nWUªv Kvcmyj 25 wg.MÖv.: cÖwZwU Kvcmyj iqQ WUªvwjb mvwWqvg \n(nvBWªU) BDGmwc 29.68 wg.MÖv. hv WUªvwjb mvwWqvg 25 wg.MÖv.

      "indications": "Indications\nIn Chronic Spasticity:  Dentro is indicated in controlling the \nmanifestations of clinical spasticity resulting from upper motor \nneuronal disorders (e.g. spinal cord injury, stroke, cerebral palsy, or \nmultiple sclerosis). It is of particular benefit to the patients whose \nfunctional rehabilitation has been retarded by the sequelae of \nspasticity. Such patients must have presumably reversible spasticity \nwhere relief of spasticity will aid in restoring residual function.\nDentro is not indicated in the treatment of skeletal muscle spasm \nresulting from rheumatic disorders.\nOccasionally, subtle but meaningful improvement in spasticity may \noccur with Dentro therapy. In such instances, information regarding \nimprovement should be solicited from the patient.\nBrief withdrawal of Dentro for a period of 2 to 4 days will frequently \ndemonstrate exacerbation of the manifestations of spasticity and may \nserve to confirm a clinical impression. \nA decision to continue the",
      "dosage": "Dosage and administration of Dentro on a long-term \nbasis is justified if introduction of the drug into the patients regimen:\n-produces a significant reduction in painful andor disabling spasticity \nsuch as clonus, or\n-permits a significant reduction in the intensity andor degree of \nnursing care required, or\n-rids the patient of any annoying manifestation of spasticity \nconsidered important by the patient himself.\nIn Malignant Hyperthermia:  Oral Dentro is also indicated \npreoperatively to prevent or attenuate the development of signs of \nmalignant hyperthermia in known, or strongly suspect, malignant \nhyperthermia susceptible patients who require anesthesia andor \nsurgery. Oral Dentro should be administered following a malignant \nhyperthermic crisis to prevent recurrence of the signs of malignant \nhyperthermia.\nDosage and administration\nFor use in Chronic Spasticity: Adults:  The following gradual \ntitration schedule is suggested. Some patients will not respond until \nhigher daily dosage is achieved. Each dosage level should be \nmaintained for seven days to determine the patients response. If no \nfurther benefit is observed at the next higher dose, dosage should be \ndecreased to the previous lower dose.\nStarting dose is 25 mg twice per day and it can be increased to 25-50 \nmg per day per week. Maximum accepted dosage is 400 mg per day.\nPaediatric Patients:  The following gradual titration schedule is \nsuggested. Some patients will not respond until higher daily dosage is \nachieved. Each dosage level should be maintained for seven days to \ndetermine the patients response. If no further benefit is observed at \nthe next higher dose, dosage should be decreased to the previous \nlower dose.\n0.5 mgkg once daily for seven days, then 0.5 mgkg 3 times for 7 \ndays, 1 mgkg 3 times for 7 days, 2 mgkg 3 times a day, Therapy with \na dose 4 times daily may be necessary for some individuals.\nFor Malignant Hyperthermia\nPreoperatively: Administer 4 to 8 mgkgday of oral Dentro in 3 or \n4 divided doses for one or two days prior to surgery, with the last dose \nbeing given approximately 3 to 4 hours before scheduled surgery with \na minimum of water. \nPost Crisis Follow-up: Oral Dentro should also be administered \nfollowing a malignant hyperthermia crisis, in doses of 4 to 8 mgkg \nper day in four divided doses, for a one to three day period to prevent \nrecurrence of the manifestations of malignant hyperthermia.",
      "side_effects": "Side Effects\nThe most frequently occurring side effects of Dentro have been \ndrowsiness, dizziness, weakness, general malaise, fatigue, and \ndiarrhea. These are generally transient, occurring early in treatment, \nand can often be obviated by beginning with a low dose and \nincreasing dosage gradually until an optimal regimen is established. \nDiarrhea may be severe and may necessitate temporary withdrawal of \nDentro therapy. If diarrhea recurs upon readministration of Dentro, \ntherapy should probably be withdrawn permanently.\nPregnancy: Pregnancy Category C: Dentro capsules should be \nused during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the \npotential risk to the fetus.\nNursing Mothers: Dentro should not be used in nursing mothers.\nUsage in Paediatric Patients: The long-term safety of Dentro in \npaediatric patients under the age of 5 years has not been established. \nBecause of the possibility that adverse effects of the drug could \nbecome apparent only after many years, a benefit-risk consideration \nof the long-term use of Dentro is particularly important in pediatric \npatients.",
      "contraindications": "Contraindications\nActive hepatic disease, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis.\nPrecautions\nDentro should be used with caution in patients with impaired \npulmonary function, and in patients with severely impaired cardiac \nfunction due to myocardial disease. It should be used with caution in \npatients with a history of previous liver disease or dysfunction.",
      "drug_interactions": "Drug Interactions\nDrowsiness may occur with Dentro therapy, and the concomitant \nadministration of CNS depressants such as sedatives and \ntranquilizing agents may result in further drowsiness. \nHepatotoxicity has occurred more often in women over 35 years of \nage receiving concomitant estrogen therapy.",

      "description": "Description\nValsartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis. \nHydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. It affects the renal tubular \nmechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing the excretion of sodium and chloride. Indirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, \nincreases in urinary potassium loss, and decrease in serum \npotassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, \nso coadministration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist \n(Valsartan) tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with thiazide diuretics.\nPharmacokinetics\nAbsorption Valsartan peak plasma concentration is reached 2 to 4 hours after dosing. Absolute bioavailability for Valsartan is about 25. Food decreases the exposure (as measured by AUC) to Valsartan by about 40 and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50. AUC and Cmax values of Valsartan increase approximately linearly with increasing dose over the clinical dosing range. Valsartan does not accumulate appreciably in plasma following repeated administration.\nMetabolism and Elimination\nValsartan, when administered as an oral solution, is primarily \nrecovered in feces (about 83 of dose) and urine (about 13 of dose). The recovery is mainly as unchanged drug, with only about 20 of dose recovered as metabolites. The enzymes responsible for Valsartan metabolism have not been identified but do not seem to be \nCYP 450 isozymes. \nHydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by \nthe kidney. At least 61 of the oral dose is eliminated as unchanged drug within 24 hours. The elimination half-life is between 5.8 and 18.9 hours.\nDistribution\nValsartan is highly bound to serum proteins (95), mainly serum \nalbumin. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta but not the \nblood-brain barrier and is excreted in breast milk.",

In a controlled clinical trial, Valsartan significantly reduced hospitalizations for heart failure.\nPost-Myocardial Infarction\nIn clinically stable patients with left ventricular failure or left \nventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction, Valsartan is \nindicated to reduce cardiovascular mortality.\nDosage & Administration\nHypertensionThe recommended starting dose of Valsartan is 80 mg or 160 mg once daily when used as monotherapy in patients who are not \nvolume depleted. Patients requiring greater reductions may be \nstarted at the higher dose. Valsartan may be used over a dose range of 80 mg to 320 mg daily, administered once daily. \nHydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 mg to 50 mg once \ndaily, and can be given at doses of 12.5 mg as Disys\n Plus. To \nminimize dose-independent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve \nthe desired effect with monotherapy.\nHeart Failure \nThe recommended starting dose of Valsartan is 40 mg twice daily. Up \ntitration to 80 mg and 160 mg twice daily should be done to the highest dose, as tolerated by the patient.\nPost-Myocardial Infarction\nDisys may be initiated as early as 12 hours after a myocardial infarction. The recommended starting dose is 20 mg twice daily. \nPatients may be uptitrated within 7 days to 40 mg twice daily, with \nsubsequent titrations to a target maintenance dose of 160 mg twice daily, as tolerated by the patient. \nContraindication\nDisys\n, Disys Plus and Disys Plus DS  are contraindicated in patients \nwho are hypersensitive to any component of the product.\nAdverse ReactionsAdverse experiences have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. The overall incidence of adverse experiences with Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide was comparable to placebo. Some adverse \nreactions such as dizziness, fatigue, pharyngitis, coughing, diarrhea \nnausea etc. may be observed.  \nSpecial Population\nPediatric\nThe pharmacokinetics of Valsartan has not been investigated in \npatients  18 years of age.\nGeriatric\nExposure (measured by AUC) to Valsartan is higher by 70 and the half-life is longer by 35 in the elderly than in the young.  No dosage \nadjustment is necessary.\nGender\nPharmacokinetics of Valsartan does not differ significantly between \nmales and females.\nHeart Failure\nThe average time to peak concentration and elimination half-life of \nValsartan in heart failure patients are similar to that observed in healthy volunteers. AUC and Cmax values of Valsartan increase \nlinearly and are almost proportional with increasing dose over the \nclinical dosing range (40 to 160 mg twice a day). The average \naccumulation factor is about 1.7 .  The apparent clearance of Valsartan following oral administration is approximately 4.5 Lh. Age does not affect the apparent clearance in heart failure patients.\nPrecautions\nRenal InsufficiencyThere is no apparent correlation between renal function (measured by creatinine clearance) and exposure (measured by AUC) to Valsartan in patients with different degrees of renal impairment. Thiazide diuretics are eliminated by kidney, with a terminal half-life of 5-15 hours. In patients with impaired renal function (mean creatinine clearance of 19 mLmin), the half-life of Hydrochlorothiazide elimination was lengthened to 21 hours.   \nHepatic Insufficiency\nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, no dosage adjustment is required. However, valsartan \nshould be used with caution. Liver disease does not significantly alter \nthe pharmacokinetics of hydrochlorothiazide. \nPregnancy & Lactation\nDue to the mechanism of action of angiotensin II antagonists, a risk for the fetus cannot be excluded. In utero exposure to ACE inhibitors given to pregnant women during the 2nd & 3rd trimesters has been \nreported to cause injury and death to the developing fetus. As for \nany drug that also acts directly on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, Valsartan should not be used during pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected during therapy, Valsartan should be discontinued as soon as possible. \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of valsartan \nduring breast-feeding, valsartan is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profile during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta and is excreted in human \nmilk. Thus, it is not advisable to use this combination in lactating mothers.\nDrug Interactions\nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed when Valsartan was coadministered with amlodipine, atenolol, cimetidine, digoxin, furosemide, glyburide, hydrochlorothiazide or \nindomethacin.\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30  ºC in a dry place.

      "side_effects": "side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve \nthe desired effect with monotherapy.\nHeart Failure \nThe recommended starting dose of Valsartan is 40 mg twice daily. Up \ntitration to 80 mg and 160 mg twice daily should be done to the highest dose, as tolerated by the patient.\nPost-Myocardial Infarction\nDisys may be initiated as early as 12 hours after a myocardial infarction. The recommended starting dose is 20 mg twice daily. \nPatients may be uptitrated within 7 days to 40 mg twice daily, with \nsubsequent titrations to a target maintenance dose of 160 mg twice daily, as tolerated by the patient. \nContraindication\nDisys\n, Disys Plus and Disys Plus DS  are contraindicated in patients \nwho are hypersensitive to any component of the product.\nAdverse ReactionsAdverse experiences have generally been mild and transient in nature and have only infrequently required discontinuation of therapy. The overall incidence of adverse experiences with Valsartan and Hydrochlorothiazide was comparable to placebo. Some adverse \nreactions such as dizziness, fatigue, pharyngitis, coughing, diarrhea \nnausea etc. may be observed.  \nSpecial Population\nPediatric\nThe pharmacokinetics of Valsartan has not been investigated in \npatients  18 years of age.\nGeriatric\nExposure (measured by AUC) to Valsartan is higher by 70 and the half-life is longer by 35 in the elderly than in the young.  No dosage \nadjustment is necessary.\nGender\nPharmacokinetics of Valsartan does not differ significantly between \nmales and females.\nHeart Failure\nThe average time to peak concentration and elimination half-life of \nValsartan in heart failure patients are similar to that observed in healthy volunteers. AUC and Cmax values of Valsartan increase \nlinearly and are almost proportional with increasing dose over the \nclinical dosing range (40 to 160 mg twice a day). The average \naccumulation factor is about 1.7 .  The apparent clearance of Valsartan following oral administration is approximately 4.5 Lh. Age does not affect the apparent clearance in heart failure patients.\nPrecautions\nRenal InsufficiencyThere is no apparent correlation between renal function (measured by creatinine clearance) and exposure (measured by AUC) to Valsartan in patients with different degrees of renal impairment. Thiazide diuretics are eliminated by kidney, with a terminal half-life of 5-15 hours. In patients with impaired renal function (mean creatinine clearance of 19 mLmin), the half-life of Hydrochlorothiazide elimination was lengthened to 21 hours.   \nHepatic Insufficiency\nIn patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, no dosage adjustment is required. However, valsartan \nshould be used with caution. Liver disease does not significantly alter \nthe pharmacokinetics of hydrochlorothiazide. \nPregnancy & Lactation\nDue to the mechanism of action of angiotensin II antagonists, a risk for the fetus cannot be excluded. In utero exposure to ACE inhibitors given to pregnant women during the 2nd & 3rd trimesters has been \nreported to cause injury and death to the developing fetus. As for \nany drug that also acts directly on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, Valsartan should not be used during pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected during therapy, Valsartan should be discontinued as soon as possible. \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of valsartan \nduring breast-feeding, valsartan is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profile during breast-feeding are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.\nHydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta and is excreted in human \nmilk. Thus, it is not advisable to use this combination in lactating mothers.",

      "composition": "Composition\nDrucil Injection 250 mg: Each vial contains 5 ml of solution containing \nFluorouracil USP 250 mg as 50 mgml.\nDrucil Injection 500 mg: Each vial contains 10 ml of solution containing \nFluorouracil USP 500 mg as 50 mgml.\nPharmacological Information\nMechanism of action\nFluorouracil is inactive as such in mammalian cells but is converted into the \nactive 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) by a variety of different metabolic pathways. The drug works by inhibiting the enzyme \nthymidylate kinase which results in reduced formation of thymidine and thus \nof DNA. The active metabolite FdUMP appears to form a stable complex with the folate cofactor N-5, 10-methylene tetrahydrofolate which inactivates \nthymidylate kinase. Fluorouracil as FdUMP is also incorporated into RNA \nwhich results in fluorination of RNA. The effect of fluorouracil on living cells is limited mainly to those in the proliferative phase but while cells in the G2 \nand S phase are most affected there may be effects at any stage of the cell \ncycle.Pharmacokinetics\n5-fluorouracil is rapidly metabolized in the liver to produce biologically \ninactive metabolites which are eventually converted to carbon dioxide, eliminated by the lungs. 80 of 5-fluorouracil can be accounted for by \nconversion to respiratory carbon dioxide within 12 hr of administration. 15 \nof the drug is excreted through urine.\nClinical Information\nTherapeutic IndicationsFluorouracil is indicated alone or in combination for-\n Carcinoma of the colon or rectum\n Carcinoma of the stomach and exocrine pancreas\n Carcinoma of the liver\n Carcinoma of the breast\n Carcinoma of the bladder\n Carcinoma of the lung\n Epithelial ovarian carcinoma\n Cervical carcinoma\nDosage and AdministrationIntravenous 5-fluorouracil can be delivered by rapid intravenous bolus injection or slow infusion. \nThe vial contents can rapidly be injected directly into a peripheral vein, the \ncommonest schedules being:12-13.5 mgKg (500 mgm\n2) daily for 5 days repeated at 4-weekly intervals.\nSlow intravenous infusion requires the drug, to be diluted in 500 ml of \ndextrose 5 solution, then infused over 2-3 hr on 5 successive days.\nUsual adult dose\nFor palliative management of cancer:\nInitial Dose: 12 mgkg intravenously once daily for 4 successive days.\nMaximum Dose: 800 mgday.\nIf no toxicity is observed, 6 mgkg may be administered on the 6th, 8th, 10th, \nand 12th day (No therapy is given on days 5, 7 , 9, or 11). Discontinue at the \nend of day 12, even with no apparent toxicity. \nPoor risk patients and those who are not in an adequate nutritional state:\nInitial Dose: 6 mgkgday for 3 days.\nMaximum Dose: 400 mgday.\nIf no toxicity is observed, 3 mgkg may be administered on days 5, 7 , and 9 \n(No therapy is to be administered on days 4, 6, or 8). Discontinue at the end \nof day 9, even with no apparent toxicity.\nMaintenance therapy\nIn instances where toxicity has not been a problem, it is recommended that \ntherapy be continued using either of the following schedules:1. Repeat the dosage of the first course every 30 days after the last day of the \nprevious course, or \n2. When the toxic signs resulting from the initial course of therapy have \nsubsided, administer a maintenance dose of 10 to 15 mgkgweek as a \nsingle dose.\nMaximum Dose: 1gweek .The reaction by the patient to the previous course \nof therapy should be taken into account and the dosage should be adjusted \naccordingly.\nUsual adult dose for cervical cancer\nIn combination with cisplatin 1gmm\n2 IV on day 1. The cycle is repeated every \n21 days.\nUsual pediatric dose for malignant disease\nThe manufacturer has reported that the safety and effectiveness of fluorouracil have not been established in children. However, the drug has been used in children following adult guidelines.\nIntra-arterial infusion\nFluorouracil has also been given by intra-arterial infusion for adult in doses \nof 5 to 7 .5 mgkg body weight is dissolved in 20-100 ml of 5 Dextrose solution and administered 10-20 days by using an infusion pump.\nCombination with radiation\nUsual adult daily dose of 5-10 mgkg body weight is given in combination with radiation according to systemic administration method or intra-arterial \ninfusion method.\nCombination with other anticancer drugs\nFluorouracil is used alone or in combination in the adjuvant treatment of \nbreast and gastro-intestinal cancer, and palliation of inoperable malignant \nneoplasms, especially those of the gastro-intestinal tract, breast, head and neck, liver, genito-urinary system, and pancreas. It is also used with \ncyclophosphamide and methotrexate in the combination chemotherapy of \nbreast cancer.A usual adult dose of 5 to 10 mgkg body weight daily is given in \ncombination with other anticancer drugs every day or intermittently once to \ntwice a week by systemic administration method or intra-arterial infusion method.\nSide Effects\nPotentially life-threatening effects\nSevere effects from 5-fluorouracil are related to the dosage and duration of \ntherapy.\nCardiac effects\nOccasional case reports associating 5-fluorouracil therapy with ischemic \ncardiac events evidence against the autoimmune phenomenon is the fact that in several cases cardiotoxicity occurred within several hours of the first \ndose.\nHematological effects\nPotentially lethal effects caused by severe hematological toxicity may develop \nwithin the first 10 days of treatment being instituted but generally resolves \nwithin 3 weeks. At the recommended dose and schedule it is rather uncommon for hematological toxicity to be severe. Any ontribute to severe \neffects from 5-fluorouracil on the blood-forming cells. Thus extensive prior \nirradiation or the concomitant use of cytotoxic drugs tend to exacerbate the severity of the hematological side effects of 5-fluorouracil.\nNeurological effects\nEffects on the central nervous system have been occasionally reported and cerebral ataxia is dose-dependent with an incidence of between 3.1 and 7. \nAcute cerebellar syndromes and myelopathy have been described following \nintrathecal 5-fluorouracil. Neurological syndromes may occur rarely after carotid artery perfusion in head and neck cancer.\nOther effects\nAllergic reaction (including difficulty in breathing, closing of the throat, swelling of the lips, tongue, or face, or hives), decreased bone marrow \nfunction and blood problems (extreme fatigue, easy bruising or bleeding, \nblack, bloody or tarry stools, or fever, chills, or signs of infection), hand-foot syndrome (tingling, pain, redness, swelling or tenderness of the hands and \nfeet), severe vomiting, diarrhoea, frequent bowel movements or watery stools, \nor sores in the mouth or throat, or stomach pain or heartburn or black, bloody or tarry stools. Other less serious side effects may include mild to \nmoderate nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite, balance problems, confusion, \nrash and itching, or temporary hair loss.Conjunctivitis, both acute and chronic can proceed to tear duct stenosis and \nectropion following prolonged administration. Very chronic administration, \nextending beyond 3 months, of low dosage has been associated with low systemic toxicity but includes the possibility of painful and tender hands and \nfeet associated with erythema of the extremities.\nContraindications\nPregnancy\nFluorouracil is contraindicated throughout pregnancy. The literature pertaining to pregnancy and cytotoxic drugs is necessarily limited but it \nappears in general that risk of teratogenesis diminishes with the \nadvancement of pregnancy. Therefore most cytotoxic drugs are absolutely contraindicated in the first trimester and 5-fluorouracil, used in the first \ntrimester has been reported to cause multiple congenital abnormalities. \nThere are many case reports, however, of pregnancy being conducted \nsuccessfully with combination chemotherapy being given to the mother \nduring the second and third trimesters. Because of the age of the population \nand the natural history of the tumors treated, most of the data on long-term follow-up pertain to therapy for leukemias. More data need to be accrued on \nthe subsequent development of neonates before it is certain that any of \nthese compounds are free of late effects.Precaution and warning5-fluorouracil is highly toxic drug with a narrow margin of safety. Therefore \npatients should be carefully supervised, since therapeutic response is \nunlikely to occur without some evidence of toxicity. Daily dose should not exceed 1 gram. Treatment should be discontinued promptly when one of the \nfollowing signs of toxicity appears:\nLeucopenia (WBC under 3500mm\n3). Thrombocytopenia (platelet under \n100000mm3). Stomatitis ( the first small ulceration at the inner margin of the \nlips is a signal for stopping treatment). Severe diarrhoea (frequent bowel \nmovements and watery stools). Gastro-intestinal ulceration and bleeding.\nDrug interaction\nPre-treatment with cimetidine for 4 weeks led to increased plasma \nconcentrations of fluorouracil following intravenous and oral administration in 6 patients. The effect was probably due to a combination of hepatic \nenzyme inhibition and reduced hepatic blood flow. \nAcute overdose\nCases of deliberate overdose are unknown but excessive toxicity because of \nthe hematological effects as described above. There is no specific antidote to 5-fluorouracil toxicity; treatment consists in supportive care. In addition to \nthe hematological toxicity other toxicities will occur with overdose.\nHigh risk groups\nNeonates\nNo dosage recommendations are made for neonates.\nLactating motherIt is not known whether fluorouracil is excreted in human milk. Because \nfluorouracil inhibits DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, mothers should not \nnurse while receiving this drug.Children\nSafety and effectiveness in children have not been established.\nThe elderlyNo special precautions are required, doses being adjusted for the patients \nweight and height.\nSymptoms and treatment for overdose and antidoteSign and symptoms are qualitatively similar to the side effects. Treatment \nshould be performed promptly and appropriate drugs are given to control \nsymptoms of overdose.Instructions for use, handling and disposal\n5-Fluorouracil is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and, caution should be \nexercised in handling 5-Fluorouracil. Special, trained personnel should reconstitute the drug. Preparation requires a room reserved for this purpose. \nThe work surface should be covered with disposable plastic-backed \nabsorbent paper. Smoking, eating and drinking are prohibited in the room. The handling staff must have a set of appropriate equipment, particularly \nlong-sleeved coats, protective masks, caps, protective goggles, sterile \ndisposable gloves, worktop protection sheets and waste collection containers and bags. If 5-Fluorouracil solution contacts the skin, wash the skin \nimmediately and thoroughly with soap and water. Following topical exposure, \nevents have included tingling, burning and redness. If 5-Fluorouracil contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flashed thoroughly \nwith water. Pregnant women must be warned and avoid handling cytotoxic \nagents.

      "composition": "Composition\nEdvila-M 50500 mg Tablet: Each film coated tablet \ncontains Vildagliptin INN 50 mg and Metformin \nHydrochloride BP 500 mg. \nEdvila-M 50850 mg Tablet: Each film coated tablet \ncontains Vildagliptin INN 50 mg and Metformin \nHydrochloride BP 850 mg. \nPharmacology\nEdvila-M combines two antihyperglycemic agents \nwith complementary mechanisms of action to improve \nglycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: \nVildagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, \nand Metformin hydrochloride, a member of the \nbiguanide class. Vildagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 \n(DPP-4) inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions \nin patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the \ninactivation of incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, \nincluding glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and \nglucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), \nare released by the intestine throughout the day, and \nlevels are increased in response to a meal. These \nhormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, \nDPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system \ninvolved in the physiologic regulation of glucose \nhomeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are \nnormal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin \nsynthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by \nintracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. \nGLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic \nalpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose \nproduction. By increasing and prolonging active \nincretin levels, Vildagliptin increases insulin release \nand decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a \nglucose-dependent manner. The pharmacologic \nmechanism of action of Metformin is different from \nother classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. \nMetformin decreases hepatic glucose production, \ndecreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and \nincreases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. \nIndication and Usage\nEdvila-M is indicated as an adjunct to diet and \nexercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type \n2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both \nVildagliptin and Metformin is appropriate.\nDosage & administration\nAdults: Based on the patients current dose of \nMetformin, Combination of Vildagliptin & Metformin \nmay be initiated at either 50 mg500 mg or 50 mg850 \nmg twice daily, 1 tab in the morning and the other in \nthe evening. The recommended daily dose is 100 mg \nVildagliptin plus 2000 mg Metformin HCl. Patients \nreceiving Vildagliptin and Metformin from separate \ntablets may be switched to Combination of Vildagliptin \n& Metformin containing the same doses of each \ncomponent. Doses higher than 100 mg of Vildagliptin is \nnot recommended. There is no clinical experience of \nVildagliptin and Metformin in triple combination with \nother antidiabetic agents. Taking Combination of \nVildagliptin & Metformin with or just after food may \nreduce gastrointestinal symptoms associated with \nMetformin.\nContraindications\nCombination (Vildagliptin & Metformin HCl) is \ncontraindicated in patients with:\n Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of \nthe excipients\n Patients with Renal Impairment: Creatinine clearance \n75 years. Therefore, the use of \nCombination of Vildagliptin & Metformin is not \nrecommended in this \npopulation.\nDrug interaction\nIn pharmacokinetic studies, no interactions were seen \nwith pioglitazone, metformin, glibenclamide, digoxin, \nwarfarin, amlodipine, ramipril, valsartan or simvastatin. \nAs with other oral antidiabetic medicinal products the  \nglucose-lowering effect of Vildagliptin may be reduced \nby certain active substances, including thiazides, \ncorticosteroids, thyroid products and sympathomimetics. \nClose monitoring of glycemic control is required, when  \ncationic drugs are co-administered. Glucocorticoids, \nbeta-2 agonists, diuretics and ACE inhibitors may alter \nblood glucose. The patient should be informed and \nmore frequent blood glucose monitoring performed, \nespecially at the beginning of treatment. If necessary, \nthe dosage of Vildagliptin & Metformin tablets may \nneed to be adjusted during concomitant therapy and \non its discontinuation.\nSupply\nEdvila-M 50500 mg Tablet: Each box contains 3X7s \ntablets in Alu-Alu blister pack.\nEdvila-M 50850 mg Tablet: Each box contains 5X4s \ntablets in Alu-Alu blister pack.\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30 ºC in a dry place. \nProtect from light.\n  Medicine:  Keep out of reach of children\n13002113Edvila-M\n \nVildagliptin INN  Metformin Hydrochloride BP\nManufactured by\nHealthcare Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\nGazariapara, Rajendrapur\nGazipur-1703, Bangladesh\nGWwfjv -Fo\nKnucJKVäkKaj IJAFjFj  ßoalrKoj yJAPcsJPTîJrJAc KmKk\nCkJhJj\nGWwfjv-Fo 50500 Ko.VJ. aqJmPua: kKfKa Kluì ßTJPac \naqJmPuPa IJPZ KnucJKVäkKaj IJAFjFj 50 Ko.VJ.

      "composition": "Composition\nEdvila 50 mg Tablet: Each tablet contains Vildagliptin \nINN 50 mg.\nPharmacology\nVildagliptin, a member of the islet enhancer class, is a \npotent and selective dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) \ninhibitor that improves glycaemic control: The \nadministration of vildagliptin results in rapid and \ncomplete inhibition of DPP-4 activity. In patients with \ntype 2 diabetes, administration of vildagliptin led to \ninhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour \nperiod. Vildagliptin inhibition of DPP-4 results in \nincreased fasting and postprandial endogenous levels \nof the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide \n1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic \npolypeptide). By increasing the endogenous levels of \nthese incretin hormones, vildagliptin enhances the \nsensitivity of beta cells to glucose resulting in improved \nglucose-dependent insulin secretion. Treatment with 50 \nto 100mg daily in patients with type 2 diabetes \nsignificantly improved markers of beta cell function. \nThe degree of improvement in beta-cell function is \ndependent on the initial degree of impairment; in \nnon-diabetic (normal glycaemic) individuals, \nvildagliptin does not stimulate insulin secretion or \nreduce glucose levels. By increasing endogenous \nGLP-1 levels, vildagliptin enhances the sensitivity of \nalpha cells to glucose, resulting in more \nglucose-appropriate glucagon secretion. The reduction \nin inappropriate glucagon during meals in turn \nattenuates insulin resistance.

      "dosage": "Dosage & administration of vildagliptin results in rapid and \ncomplete inhibition of DPP-4 activity. In patients with \ntype 2 diabetes, administration of vildagliptin led to \ninhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour \nperiod. Vildagliptin inhibition of DPP-4 results in \nincreased fasting and postprandial endogenous levels \nof the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide \n1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic \npolypeptide). By increasing the endogenous levels of \nthese incretin hormones, vildagliptin enhances the \nsensitivity of beta cells to glucose resulting in improved \nglucose-dependent insulin secretion. Treatment with 50 \nto 100mg daily in patients with type 2 diabetes \nsignificantly improved markers of beta cell function. \nThe degree of improvement in beta-cell function is \ndependent on the initial degree of impairment; in \nnon-diabetic (normal glycaemic) individuals, \nvildagliptin does not stimulate insulin secretion or \nreduce glucose levels. By increasing endogenous \nGLP-1 levels, vildagliptin enhances the sensitivity of \nalpha cells to glucose, resulting in more \nglucose-appropriate glucagon secretion. The reduction \nin inappropriate glucagon during meals in turn \nattenuates insulin resistance. The enhanced increase in \nthe insulinglucagon ratio during hyperglycemia due to \nincreased incretin hormone levels results in a decrease \nin fasting and postprandial hepatic glucose production, \nleading to reduced glycaemia.\nIndications and usage\nEdvila is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise \nto improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 \ndiabetes mellitus. \nl As monotherapy,\nl In dual combination with Metformin, a Sulphonylurea, \na Thiazolidinedione, or Insulin when diet,exercise and a \nsingle antidiabetic agent do not result in adequate \nglycaemic control. \nDosage & administration\nThe recommended dose of a Edvila is \nl 50 mg or 100 mg daily for monotherapy\nl 50 mg twice daily (morning and evening) when used in \ndual combination with Metformin or a Thiazolidinedione\nl 50 mg once daily in the morning when used in dual \ncombination with a Sulphonylurea\nEdvila may be taken with or without a meal.

Oral supplements of Efynal are essential \nin adults, even where there is fat malabsorption secondary to \ncholestasis. In chronic fat malabsorption, e.g. in cystic fibrosis, \nataxia and visual scotomas which respond to vitamin E.\nMore recently it has been suggested that, as a lipid soluble \nantioxidant, vitamin E may reduce atherogenesis by \nprotecting low-density lipoprotein from oxidation. If the \nintake of polyunsaturated fat is high, vitamin E intake should \nbe increased.\nEfynal has also been used in cancer, skin conditions, \nnocturnal leg cramps, sexual dysfunction, heart disease, \naging, premenstrual syndrome, fibrocystic disease of the breast, air polution, hair loss, acne, to ease menopause and  \nto increase athletic performance.",
      "dosage": "Dosage and administration:\nThe daily intake of Efynal (vitamin E) in the range 200 mg-\n600 mg is considered safe. The recommended dose is one \ntablet to be chewed one or two times daily with or after \nmeals or as prescribed by the physicians.\nContraindication:\nNo known",

      "composition": "COMPOSITION\nELMISAN Capsule 100 mg: Each Capsule contains Pentosan \nPolysulfate Sodium INN 100 mg. \nINDICATIONS AND USAGE \nELMISAN (pentosan polysulfate sodium) is indicated for the \nrelief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. \nCONTRAINDICATIONS \nELMISAN is contraindicated in patients with known \nhypersensitivity to the drug structurally related compounds or excipients. \nWARNINGS \nNone\nPRECAUTIONS \nGeneral ELMISAN\n is a weak anticoagulant (115 the activity of \nheparin). At a daily dose of 300 mg (n  128), rectal hemorrhage was reported as an adverse event in 6.3 of patients. Bleeding complications of ecchymosis, epistaxis, and gum hemorrhage have been reported . Patients undergoing invasive procedures or having signssymptoms of underlying coagulopathy or other increased risk of bleeding (due to other therapies such as coumarin anticoagulants, heparin, t-PA, streptokinase, high dose aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) should be evaluated for hemorrhage. Patients with diseases such as aneurysms, thrombocytopenia, hemophilia, gastrointestinal ulcerations, polyps, or diverticula should be carefully evaluated before starting ELMISAN\n. A \nsimilar product that was given subcutaneously, sublingually, or intramuscularly (and not initially metabolized by the liver) is associated with delayed immunoallergic thrombocytopenia with symptoms of thrombosis and hemorrhage. \nPregnancy \nReproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats with intravenous daily doses of 15 mgkg, and in rabbits with 7 .5 mgkg. These doses are 0.42 and 0.14 times the daily oral human doses of ELMISAN\n when normalized to body surface \narea. These studies did not reveal evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus from ELMISAN. This drug should be used \nin pregnancy only if clearly needed.\nNursing Mothers \nIt is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when ELMISAN\n is administered to a \nnursing woman. \nPediatric Use \nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 16 years have not been established. \nAdverse Reactions \nELMISAN was evaluated in clinical trials in a total of 2627 \npatients (2343 women, 262 men, 22 unknown) with a mean age of 47 range 18 to 88 with 581 (22) over 60 years of age. Of the 2,627 patients, 128 patients were in a 3-month trial and the remaining 2,499 patients were in a long-term, unblinded trial. Deaths occurred in 62,627 (0.2) patients who received the drug over a period of 3 to 75 months. The deaths appear to be related to other concurrent illnesses or procedures, except in one patient for whom the cause was not known. \nAdverse Experience in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials \nof ELMISAN\n 100 mg Three Times a Day for 3 MonthsOVERDOSAGE  \nOverdose has not been reported. Based upon the pharmacodynamics of the drug, toxicity is likely to be reflected as anticoagulation, bleeding, thrombocytopenia, liver function abnormalities, and gastric distress.  At a daily dose of 900 mg for 32 weeks (n  127) in a clinical trial, rectal hemorrhage was reported as an adverse event in 15 of patients. At a daily dose of ELMISAN\n 900 mg for 16 weeks in a clinical trial that \nenrolled 51 patients in the ELMISAN group and 49 in the \nplacebo group, elevated liver function tests were reported as an adverse event in 11.8 of patients in the ELMISAN group and \n2 of patients in the placebo group. In the event of acute overdosage, the patient should be given gastric lavage if possible, carefully observed and given symptomatic and supportive treatment.\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \nThe recommended dose of ELMISAN\n is 100 mg taken as \norally three times daily. The capsules should be taken with water at least 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals. Patients receiving ELMISAN\n should be reassessed after 3 \nmonths.

      "composition": "Composition\nElvina Tablet 250 mg: Each tablet contains Terbinafine \nHydrochloride EP equivalent to Terbinafine 250 mg.\nElvina Cream 1: Each gram cream contains Terbinafine \nHydrochloride EP equivalent to Terbinafine 10 mg.\nPharmacology\nTerbinafine hydrochloride (Elvina) is a synthetic allylamine \nantifungal. It is highly lipophilic in nature and tends to accumulate in \nskin, nails, and fatty tissues. Like other allylamines, terbinafine \ninhibits ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting the fungal squalene \nmonooxygenase (squalene 2,3-epoxidase), an enzyme that is part of \nthe fungal cell wall synthesis pathway.\nIndications\nFungal infections of the skin caused by dermatophytes such as \nTrichophyton rubrum, Tricophyton mentagrophytes, Mychrosporum \ncanis and Epidermophyton floccosum.\nElvina Tablet\n Onychomycosis of the toenail or fingernail due to dermatophytes\n Ringworm (Tinea corporis, Tinea cruris and Tinea pedis) where oral \ntherapy is considered appropriate due to the site, severity or extent of \nthe infection.\nElvina Cream\n Yeast infection of the skin principally caused by the genus Candida \n(e.g. Candida Albicans)\n Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor due to Pityrosporum orbiculare (also \nknown as Malassezia furfur)\nDosage & Administration\nTablet:\nIn each indication, dose of Elvina tablet is 250 mg once daily \n(duration of treatment varies according to the indication and the \nseverity of the indications).\nIn case of Onychomycosis, the optimal clinical effect is seen some \nafter mychological cure and cessation of treatment. This is related to \nthe period required for overgrowth of healthy nail.\nCream:\nElvina Cream can be applied once or twice daily (duration of \ntreatment varies according to the indication and the severity of \ninfections.). Cleanse and dry the affected areas thoroughly before \napplication of cream. Apply the cream to the affected skin and \nsurrounding area in the thin layer and rub in lightly.\nRelief of clinical symptoms usually occurs within a few days. The \ntreatment must be used regularly and for an adequate length of time. \nIrregular use of premature discontinuation of treatment carries the \nrisk of recurrence. If there is no sign of improvement after two weeks, \nthe diagnosis should be verified.\nContraindications\n Known hypersensitivity to terbinafine or to any of the excipients of \nTerbinafine tablets & cream.\n Chronic or active hepatic disease.\nPrecautions \nElvina tablets & cream are contraindicated for patients with chronic \nor active hepatic disease. Before prescribing Terbinafine tablets, a \nliver function test should be performed and any pre-existing liver \ndisease should be assessed. Patients prescribed Lamisil tablets \nshould be instructed to report immediately any signs or symptoms \nsuggestive of liver dysfunction such as pruritus, unexplained \npersistent nausea, decreased appetite, anorexia, jaundice, vomiting, \nfatigue, right upper abdominal pain, dark urine, or pale stools. \nPatients with these symptoms should discontinue taking oral \nterbinafine and the patients liver function should be immediately \nevaluated.Serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic \nepidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic \nsymptoms) have been very rarely reported in patients taking \nTerbinafine tablets. If progressive skin rash occurs, Terbinafine \ntablets treatment should be discontinued.\nElvina should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing \npsoriasis, as very rare cases of exacerbation of psoriasis have been \nreported.\nVery rare cases of blood dyscrasias (neutropenia, agranulocytosis, \nthrombocytopenia, pancytopenia) have been reported in patients \ntreated with Terbinafine tablets. Aetiology of any blood dyscrasias \nthat occur in patients treated with Elvina tablets & cream should be \nevaluated and consideration should be given for a possible change \nin medication regimen, including discontinuation of treatment with \nElvina tablets & cream.\nIn patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 50 \nmLmin or serum creatinine of more than 300 micro molL) the use \nof Terbinafine tablets & cream has not been adequately studied, and \ntherefore, is not recommended.\nSide effects\nSide effects are generally mild to moderate, and transient. The most \nfrequently reported adverse effects: Gastrointestinal symptoms \n(feeling of fullness abdominal distension, dyspepsia, nausea, \nabdominal pain, diarrhoea), Rash, urticarial, Musculoskeletal \nreactions (arthralgia, myalgia).\nUse in Pregnancy and lactation\nPregnancy\nSince clinical experience in pregnant women is very limited, Elvina \nshould not be used during pregnancy.\nLactation\nElvina is excreted in breast milk and therefore mothers should not \nreceive Elvina treatment whilst breast-feeding.\nFertility\nFoetal toxicity and fertility studies in animals suggest no adverse \neffects.\nUse in Children and Geriatric patients\nChildren\nAs data is still limited, its use is not recommended.\nGeriatric patients\nThere is no evidence to suggest that elderly patients (aged 65 years \nor above) require different dosages or experience side-effects \ndifferent to those of younger patients. The possibility of impairment \nof liver or kidney function should be considered in this age group.\nThe scored tablets are taken orally with water. They should \npreferably be taken at the same time each day and can be taken on \nan empty stomach or after a meal.\nDrug interactions\nElvina is an inhibitor of CYP4502D6 isozyme and has an effect on \nmetabolism of desipramine, cimetidine, fluconazole, cyclosporine, \nrifampin, and caffeine. \nOver dosage\nA few cases of overdose (up to 5g) have been reported, giving rise to \nheadache, nausea, upper abdominal pain and dizziness. \nStorage\nElvina Tablet 250 mg: Store at a temperature not exceeding 30 C in \na dry place.

      "dosage": "Dosage & Administration\nTablet:\nIn each indication, dose of Elvina tablet is 250 mg once daily \n(duration of treatment varies according to the indication and the \nseverity of the indications).\nIn case of Onychomycosis, the optimal clinical effect is seen some \nafter mychological cure and cessation of treatment. This is related to \nthe period required for overgrowth of healthy nail.\nCream:\nElvina Cream can be applied once or twice daily (duration of \ntreatment varies according to the indication and the severity of \ninfections.). Cleanse and dry the affected areas thoroughly before \napplication of cream. Apply the cream to the affected skin and \nsurrounding area in the thin layer and rub in lightly.\nRelief of clinical symptoms usually occurs within a few days. The \ntreatment must be used regularly and for an adequate length of time. \nIrregular use of premature discontinuation of treatment carries the \nrisk of recurrence. If there is no sign of improvement after two weeks, \nthe diagnosis should be verified.",
      "side_effects": "Side effects\nSide effects are generally mild to moderate, and transient. The most \nfrequently reported adverse effects: Gastrointestinal symptoms \n(feeling of fullness abdominal distension, dyspepsia, nausea, \nabdominal pain, diarrhoea), Rash, urticarial, Musculoskeletal \nreactions (arthralgia, myalgia).\nUse in Pregnancy and lactation\nPregnancy\nSince clinical experience in pregnant women is very limited, Elvina \nshould not be used during pregnancy.\nLactation\nElvina is excreted in breast milk and therefore mothers should not \nreceive Elvina treatment whilst breast-feeding.\nFertility\nFoetal toxicity and fertility studies in animals suggest no adverse \neffects.\nUse in Children and Geriatric patients\nChildren\nAs data is still limited, its use is not recommended.\nGeriatric patients\nThere is no evidence to suggest that elderly patients (aged 65 years \nor above) require different dosages or experience side-effects \ndifferent to those of younger patients. The possibility of impairment \nof liver or kidney function should be considered in this age group.\nThe scored tablets are taken orally with water. They should \npreferably be taken at the same time each day and can be taken on \nan empty stomach or after a meal.",
      "contraindications": "Contraindications\n Known hypersensitivity to terbinafine or to any of the excipients of \nTerbinafine tablets & cream.\n Chronic or active hepatic disease.\nPrecautions \nElvina tablets & cream are contraindicated for patients with chronic \nor active hepatic disease. Before prescribing Terbinafine tablets, a \nliver function test should be performed and any pre-existing liver \ndisease should be assessed. Patients prescribed Lamisil tablets \nshould be instructed to report immediately any signs or symptoms \nsuggestive of liver dysfunction such as pruritus, unexplained \npersistent nausea, decreased appetite, anorexia, jaundice, vomiting, \nfatigue, right upper abdominal pain, dark urine, or pale stools. \nPatients with these symptoms should discontinue taking oral \nterbinafine and the patients liver function should be immediately \nevaluated.Serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic \nepidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic \nsymptoms) have been very rarely reported in patients taking \nTerbinafine tablets. If progressive skin rash occurs, Terbinafine \ntablets treatment should be discontinued.\nElvina should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing \npsoriasis, as very rare cases of exacerbation of psoriasis have been \nreported.\nVery rare cases of blood dyscrasias (neutropenia, agranulocytosis, \nthrombocytopenia, pancytopenia) have been reported in patients \ntreated with Terbinafine tablets. Aetiology of any blood dyscrasias \nthat occur in patients treated with Elvina tablets & cream should be \nevaluated and consideration should be given for a possible change \nin medication regimen, including discontinuation of treatment with \nElvina tablets & cream.\nIn patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 50 \nmLmin or serum creatinine of more than 300 micro molL) the use \nof Terbinafine tablets & cream has not been adequately studied, and \ntherefore, is not recommended.",

      "composition": "Composition\nEpirubin injection 50 mg: Each vial contains Epirubicin Hydrochloride USP 50 mg.\nPharmacology\nEpirubicin is an anthracycline cytotoxic agent. Although it is known that anthracyclines can interfere with a number of biochemical and biological functions within eukaryotic cells, the precise mechanisms of epirubicins cytotoxic andor antiproliferative properties have not been completely elucidated.Epirubicin forms a complex with DNA by intercalation of its planar rings between nucleotide base pairs, with consequent inhibition of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and protein synthesis.\nDistribution\nFollowing intravenous administration, epirubicin is rapidly and widely distributed into the tissues. Binding of epirubicin to plasma proteins, predominantly albumin, is about 77 and is not affected by drug concentration.\nMetabolism\nEpirubicin is extensively and rapidly metabolized by the liver and is also metabolized by other organs and cells, including red blood cells. Four main metabolic routes have been identified:(1) reduction of the C-13 keto-group with the formation of the 13(S)-dihydro derivative, epirubicinol; (2) conjugation of both the unchanged drug and epirubicinol with glucuronic acid; (3) loss of the amino sugar moiety through a hydrolytic process with the formation of the doxorubicin and doxorubicinol aglycones; and (4) loss of the amino sugar moiety through a redox process with the formation of the 7-deoxy-doxorubicin aglycone and 7-deoxy-doxorubicinol aglycone. Epirubicinol has in vitro cytotoxic activity one-tenth that of epirubicin. As plasma levels of epirubicinol are lower than those of the unchanged drug, they are unlikely to reach in vivo concentrations sufficient for cytotoxicity. No significant activity or toxicity has been reported for the other metabolites.\nExcretion\nEpirubicin and its major metabolites are eliminated through biliary excretion and, to a lesser extent, by urinary excretion. Mass-balance data from 1 patient found about 60 of the total radioactive dose in feces (34) and urine (27). These data are consistent with those from 3 patients with extrahepatic obstruction and percutaneous drainage, in whom approximately 35 and 20 of the administered dose were recovered as epirubicin or its major metabolites in bile and urine, respectively, in the 4 days after treatment.\nEffect of Age\nA population analysis of plasma data from 36 cancer patients (13 males and 23 females, 20 to 73 years) showed that age affects plasma clearance of epirubicin in female patients. The predicted plasma clearance for a female patient of 70 years of \nage was about 35 lower than that for a female patient of 25 \nyears of age. An insufficient number of males  50 years of age were included in the study to draw conclusions about age-related alterations in clearance in males. Although a lower ELLENCE starting dose does not appear necessary in elderly female patients, and was not used in clinical trials, particular care should be taken in monitoring toxicity when Epirubicin is administered to female patients  70 years of age.\nEffect of Gender\nIn patients  50 years of age, mean clearance values in adult male and female patients were similar. The clearance of epirubicin is decreased in elderly women.\nEffect of Race\nThe influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of epirubicin has not been evaluated.\nEffect of Hepatic Impairment\nEpirubicin is eliminated by both hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion and clearance is reduced in patients with hepatic dysfunction. In a study of the effect of hepatic dysfunction, patients with solid tumors were classified into 3 groups. Patients in Group 1 (n22) had serum AST (SGOT) levels above the upper limit of normal (median: 93 IUL) and normal serum Epirubin\nEpirubicin Hydrochloride USP\nbilirubin levels (median: 0.5 mgdL) and were given Epirubicin doses of 12.5 to 90 mgm2. Patients in Group 2 had alterations in both serum AST (median: 175 IUL) and bilirubin levels (median: 2.7 mgdL) and were treated with an Epirubicin dose of 25 mgm2 (n8). Their pharmacokinetics were compared to those of patients with normal serum AST and bilirubin values, who received Epirubicin doses of 12.5 to 120 mgm2. The median plasma clearance of epirubicin was decreased compared to patients with normal hepatic function by about 30 in patients in Group 1 and by 50 in patients in Group 2. Patients with more severe hepatic impairment have not been evaluated.\nEffect of Renal Impairment\nNo significant alterations in the pharmacokinetics of epirubicin or its major metabolite, epirubicinol, have been observed in patients with serum creatinine  5 mgdL. A 50 reduction in plasma clearance was reported in four patients with serum creatinine  5 mgdL see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and \nDosing and Administration (2.2). Patients on dialysis have not been studied.\nIndication\nEpirubicin Injection is an anthracycline topoisomerase II inhibitor indicated as a component of adjuvant therapy in patients with evidence of axillary node primary breast cancer.\nDosage and administration\nThe recommended starting dose is 100 to 120 mgm2. Reduce dose in patients with hepatic impairment. Consider lower doses in patients with severe renal impairment.\nContraindication\nPatients should not be treated with Epirubicin Injection if they have any of the following conditions: baseline neutrophil count 1500 cellsmm3; severe myocardial insufficiency, recent myocardial infarction, severe arrhythmias; previous treatment with anthracyclines up to the maximum cumulative dose; hypersensitivity to epirubicin, other anthracyclines, or anthracenediones; or severe hepatic dysfunction.\nWarning and precaution\nCardiotoxicity is a known risk of anthracycline treatment and may be manifested by early (or acute) or late (delayed) events.Serum total bilirubin and AST levels should be evaluated before and during treatment.Serum creatinine should be assessed before and during therapy.\nSide effects\nGeneral: Neutropenia, Anaemia, Fatigue, Nausea. Rare: LVEF, CHF\nPregnancy\nPregnancy category D\nNursing Mothers\nDiscontinue nursing prior to taking Epirubicin\nPediatric Use\nSafety and effectiveness of Epirubicin in pediatric patients have not been established. \nGeriatric Use\nCare should be taken in monitoring toxicity when Epirubicin is administered to female patients  70 years of age.\nStorage\nStore refrigerated between 2ºC and 8ºC.

      "description": "Description\nEscitalopram is an oral drug that is used for treating depression and \ngeneralized anxiety disorder. It works by affecting neurotransmitters \nin the brain, the chemical messengers that nerves use to \ncommunicate with one another. Neurotransmitters are made and \nreleased by nerves and then travel to other nearby nerves where they \nattach to receptors on the nerves. Some neurotransmitters that are \nreleased do not bind to receptors and are taken up by the nerves \nthat produced them. This is referred to as reuptake. Many experts \nbelieve that an imbalance of neurotransmitters is the cause of \ndepression. Escitalopram prevents the reuptake of one \nneurotransmitter, serotonin, by nerves, an action which results in \nmore serotonin in the brain to attach to receptors. Chemically, \nescitalopram is very similar to citalopram. Both are in the class of \ndrugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). \nActive Ingredients\nEsita 5 mg tablet: Each film coated tablet contains Escitalopram \nOxalate INN equivalent to Escitalopram 5 mg.\nEsita 10 mg tablet: Each film coated tablet contains Escitalopram \nOxalate INN equivalent to Escitalopram 10 mg.\nIndication\nEscitalopram is approved for the treatment of depression and \ngeneralized anxiety disorder. Drugs in the SSRI class also have been \nstudied in persons with obsessive-compulsive disorders and panic \ndisorders. \nContraindication\nConcomitant use in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors \n(MAOIs) is contraindicated. Concomitant use in patients taking \npimozide is contraindicated. Esita is contraindicated in patients with \na hypersensitivity to escitalopram or citalopram or any of the inactive \ningredients. \nSide Effects\nThe most commonly-noted side effects associated with escitalopram \nare agitation or restlessness, blurred vision, diarrhea, difficulty \nsleeping, drowsiness, dry mouth, fever, frequent urination, headache, \nindigestion, nausea, increased or decreased appetite, increased \nsweating, sexual difficulties (decreased sexual ability or desire, \nejaculatory delay), taste alterations, tremor (shaking), weight \nchanges. Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance \nand sexual satisfaction often occur as a result of depression itself, \nthey also may be a consequence of the drugs used to treat \ndepression. In particular, about one in 11 men given escitalopram \nreport difficulties experiencing ejaculation.\nPrecaution\nDuring marketing of escitalopram and other SSRIs and SNRIs \n(Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors), there have been \nspontaneous reports of adverse events occurring upon \ndiscontinuation of these drugs, particularly when abrupt, including \nthe following: dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory \ndisturbances (e.g., paresthesias such as electric shock sensations), \nanxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, \nand hypomania. While these events are generally self-limiting, there have been reports of serious discontinuation symptoms. Patients \nshould be monitored for these symptoms when discontinuing \ntreatment with escitalopram. A gradual reduction in the dose rather \nthan abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. If \nintolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon \ndiscontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previously \nprescribed dose may be considered. Subsequently, the physician may \ncontinue decreasing the dose but at a more gradual rate. \nDosage & Administration\nThe usual starting dose of escitalopram is 10 mg once daily. Benefit \nmay not be seen until treatment has been given for up to 4 weeks. \nEscitalopram can be taken with or without food.

You should allow 15 to 30 minutes for the Etacept solution in the \nsyringe to reach room temperature. Do not remove the needle cover \nwhile allowing it to reach room temperature. Waiting until the \nsolution reaches room temperature may make the injection more \ncomfortable for you. Do not warm Etacept in any other way (for \nexample, do not warm it in a microwave or in hot water).\n4. Assemble the additional supplies you will need for your injection. \nThese include the alcohol swab from the Etacept carton and a cotton \nball or gauze.Etacept\nEtanercept INN\n5. Wash your hands with soap and warm water.\n6. Inspect the solution in the syringe. It should be clear or slightly \nopalescent, colourless or pale yellow, and may contain small white or \nalmost transparent particles of protein.This appearance is normal for \nEtacept. Do not use the solution if it is discoloured, cloudy, or if \nparticles other than those described above are present. If you are \nconcerned with the appearance of the solution, then contact your \npharmacist for assistance.\nStep 2: Choosing an injection site\n1. Three recommended injection sites for Etacept using a pre-filled \nsyringe include: (1) the front of the middle thighs; (2) the abdomen, \nexcept for the 5 cm area right around the navel; and (3) the outer \narea of the upper arms (see Diagram 1). If you are self injecting, you \nshould not use the outer area of the upper arms.\nDiagram 1\n2. A different site should be used for each new injection. Each new \ninjection should be given at least 3 cm from an old site. Do not inject \ninto areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid areas \nwith scars or stretch marks. (It may be helpful to keep notes on the \nlocation of the previous injections.)\n3. If you have psoriasis, you should try not to inject directly into any \nraised, thick, red, or scaly skin patches (psoriasis skin lesions).\nStep 3: Injecting the Etacept solution\n1. Wipe the site where Etacept is to be injected with the alcohol swab, \nusing a circular motion. Do not touch this area again before giving \nthe injection.\n2. Pick up the pre-filled syringe from the flat work surface. Remove the \nneedle cover by firmly pulling it straight off the syringe (see Diagram \n2). Be careful not to bend or twist the cover during removal to avoid \ndamage to the needle.When you remove the needle cover, there may be a drop of liquid at \nthe end of the needle; this is normal. Do not touch the needle or \nallow it to touch any surface. Do not touch or bump the plunger. \nDoing so could cause the liquid to leak out.\nDiagram 2\n3. When the cleaned area of skin has dried, pinch and hold it firmly with \none hand. With the other hand, hold the syringe like a pencil.\n4. With a quick, short motion, push the needle all the way into the skin \nat an angle between 45 and 90 (see Diagram 3). With experience, \nyou will find the angle that is most comfortable for you. Be careful \nnot to push the needle into the skin too slowly, or with great force.\nDiagram 35. When the needle is completely inserted into the skin, release the skin \nthat you are holding. With your free hand, hold the syringe near its \nbase to stabilise it. Then push the plunger to inject all of the solution \nat a slow, steady rate (see Diagram 4).\nDiagram 4\n6. When the syringe is empty, pull the needle out of the skin, being \ncareful to keep it at the same angle as inserted. There may be a little \nbleeding at the injection site. You can press a cotton ball or gauze over \nthe injection site for 10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. If needed, \nyou may cover the injection site with a bandage.\nStep 4: Disposing of supplies\n The pre-filled syringe is for single-use administration only. The \nsyringe and needle should never be reused. Never recap a needle. \nDispose of the needle and syringe as instructed by your doctor, nurse \nor pharmacist.

      "contraindications": "Contraindications\nFlixocort is contraindicated in patient with \na history of hypersensitivity to any \ningredient of the preparation.\nWarning & Precaution\nIncreasing use of short-acting inhaled \nB2-agonists to control asthma symptoms \nindicates deterioration of asthma control. Under these conditions, the patients \ntherapy plan should be reassessed. \nSudden and progressive deterioration in \nasthma control is potentially \nlife-threatening and consideration should \nbe given to increasing corticosteroid \ndosage. In patients considered at risk, daily \npeak ﬂow monitoring may be instituted.\nSystemic effects may occur with any \ninhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high \ndoses prescribed for long periods; these \neffects are much less likely to occur than \nwith oral corticosteroids. It is \nrecommended that the height of children \nreceiving prolonged treatment with inhaled \ncorticosteroid is regularly monitored. It is \nimportant, therefore, that the dose of \ninhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the \nlowest dose at which effective control is \nmaintained. Treatment with Flixocort \nInhaler should not be stopped abruptly. As \nwith all inhaled corticosteroids, special \ncare is necessary in patients with active or \nquiescent pulmonary tuberculosis.Adverse Reactions\nInfections and infestations: Very common: \nCandidiasis of mouth and throat. Rare: \nOesophageal candidiasis. \nImmune system disorders: Uncommon: \nCutaneous hypersensitivity reactions. Very \nrare: Angioedema (mainly facial and \noropharyngeal oedema), respiratory \nsymptoms (dyspnoea andor \nbronchospasm) and anaphylactic \nreactions. \nEndocrine disorders: Very rare: Cushings \nsyndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal \nsuppression, growth retardation, \ndecreased bone mineral density, cataract \nand glaucoma. \nMetabolism and nutrition disorders: Very \nrare: Hyperglycaemia\nPsychiatric disorders: Very rare: Anxiety, \nsleep disorders and behavioural changes, \nincluding hyperactivity and irritability \n(predominantly in children).\nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal \ndisorders: Common: Hoarseness. Very rare: \nParadoxical bronchospasm.Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: \nCommon: Contusions\nPregnancy and Lactation\nFertility: There are no data on human \nfertility. Animal studies indicate no effects \nof ﬂuticasone propionate on male or \nfemale fertility.\nPregnancy: There are limited data in \npregnant women. Administration of \nFlixocort inhaler during pregnancy should \nonly be considered if the expected beneﬁt \non the mother is greater than any possible \nrisk to the foetus. Results from the \nretrospective epidemiological study did not \nﬁnd any increased risk of major congenital \nmalformations (MCMs) following exposure \nto ﬂuticasone propionate when compared \nto other inhaled corticosteroids, during the \nﬁrst trimester of pregnancy.\nLactation: The excretion of ﬂuticasone \npropionate into human breast milk has not \nbeen investigated. When measurable \nplasma levels were obtained in lactating laboratory rats following subcutaneous \nadministration there was evidence of \nﬂuticasone propionate in the breast milk. \nHowever, plasma levels in patients \nfollowing inhaled application of ﬂuticasone \npropionate at recommended doses are \nlikely to be low. Administration during \nlactation should only be considered if the \nexpected beneﬁt to the mother is greater \nthan any possible risk to the child.\nDrug Interaction: \nUnder normal circumstances, due to  low \nplasma concentrations of ﬂuticasone \npropionate are achieved after inhaled \ndosing, clinically signiﬁcant drug \ninteractions mediated by ﬂuticasone \npropionate are unlikely.

      "composition": "Composition\nFlowrap 4 capsule: Each capsule contains Silodosin INN 4mg.\nFlowrap 8 capsule: Each capsule contains Silodosin INN 8mg .\nIndicationsFlowrap\n (Silodosin), a selective alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist, is indicated for the treatment \nof the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Flowrap (Silodosin) is not indicated \nfor the treatment of hypertension.\nDosage and administration\nThe recommended dose is Silodosin 8mg capsule orally once daily with a meal.\nDosage adjustment in special populations\nRenal impairment: Silodosin is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (CCr  65 years of age (1.9 for placebo), and 5.0 of patients  75 years of age (0 for placebo). There were otherwise no significant differences in safety or effectiveness between older and younger patients.\nRenal impairment: The effect of renal impairment on Silodosin pharmacokinetics was evaluated in a \nsingle dose study of six male patients with moderate renal impairment and seven male subjects with normal renal function. Plasma concentrations of Silodosin were approximately three times higher in subjects with moderate renal impairment compared with subjects with normal renal function. Silodosin should be reduced to 4mg per day in patients with moderate renal impairment. Exercise caution and \nmonitor patients for adverse events. Silodosin has not been studied in patients with severe renal \nimpairment. Silodosin is contra-indicated in patients with severe renal impairment.\nHepatic impairment: In a study comparing nine male patients with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh scores 7 to 9), to nine healthy male subjects, the single dose pharmacokinetics of Silodosin were not significantly altered in patients with hepatic impairment. No dosing adjustment is required in \npatients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.\nDrug interactions: Moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: The effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of Silodosin has not been evaluated. Concomitant administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., Diltiazem, Erythromycin, Verapamil) may increase concentration of Silodosin. Exercise caution and monitor patients for adverse events when co-administering Silodosin with \nmoderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors: In vitro studies indicated that \nSilodosin is a P-gp substrate. Ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor that also inhibits P-gp, caused significant increase in exposure to Silodosin. Inhibition of P-gp may lead to increased Silodosin concentration. Silodosin is therefore not recommended in patients taking strong P-gp inhibitors such \nas Cyclosporine. Alpha-blockers: The pharmacodynamic interactions between Silodosin and other \nalpha-blockers have not been determined. However, interactions may be expected, and Silodosin should not be used in combination with other alpha-blockers. Digoxin: The effect of co-administration of Silodosin and digoxin 0.25mgday for 7 days was evaluated in a clinical trial in 16 healthy males, aged 18 to 45 years. Concomitant administration of Silodosin and Digoxin did not significantly alter the steady \nstate pharmacokinetics of Digoxin. No dose adjustment is required. PDE5 inhibitors: Co-administration \nof Silodosin with a single dose of 100mg Sildenafil or 20mg Tadalafil was evaluated in a placebo-controlled clinical study that included 24 healthy male subjects, 45 to 78 years of age. Orthostatic vital signs were monitored in the 12-hour period following concomitant dosing. During this period, the total number of positive orthostatic test results was greater in the group receiving Silodosin \nplus a PDE5 inhibitor compared with Silodosin alone. No events of symptomatic orthostasis or dizziness \nwere reported in subjects receiving Silodosin with a PDE5 inhibitor. Other concomitant drug therapy: Antihypertensives: The pharmacodynamic interactions between Silodosin and antihypertensives have not been rigorously investigated in a clinical study. However, approximately one-third of the patients in clinical studies used concomitant antihypertensive medications with Silodosin. The incidence of dizziness and orthostatic hypotension in these patients was higher than in the general Silodosin population (4.6 versus 3.8 and 3.4 versus 3.2, respectively). Exercise caution during concomitant use with antihypertensives and monitor patients for possible adverse events.\nMetabolic Interactions: In vitro data indicate that Silodosin does not have the potential to inhibit or \ninduce cytochrome P450 enzyme systems.\nFood interactions: The effect of a moderate fat, moderate calorie meal on Silodosin pharmacokinetics \nwas variable and decreased Silodosin maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) by approximately 18-43 and exposure (AUC) by 4-49 across three different studies. Safety and efficacy clinical trials for Silodosin were always conducted in the presence of food intake. Patients should be instructed to take Silodosin with a meal to reduce risk of adverse events.\nSide effect: Clinical Trials Experience: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying \nconditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly \ncompared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in \nclinical practice. In U.S. clinical trials, 897 patients with BPH were exposed to 8mg Silodosin daily. \nThis includes 486 patients exposed for 6 months and 168 patients exposed for 1 year. The population \nwas 44 to 87 years of age, and predominantly Caucasian. Of these patients, 42.8 were 65 years of age or older and 10.7 were 75 years of age or older. In double-blind, placebo controlled, 12-week \nclinical trials, 466 patients were administered Silodosin and 457 patients were administered placebo. \nAt least one treatment-emergent adverse reaction was reported by 55.2 of Silodosin treated \npatients (36.8 for placebo treated). The majority (72.1) of adverse reactions for the Silodosin \ntreated patients (59.8 for placebo treated) were qualified by the investigator as mild. A total of 6.4 \nof Silodosin treated patients (2.2 for placebo treated) discontinued therapy due to an adverse reaction (treatment-emergent), the most common reaction being retrograde ejaculation (2.8) for Silodosin treated patients. Retrograde ejaculation is reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. \nAdverse Reactions observed in at least 2 of patients: The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse \nreactions listed in the following table were derived from two 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled clinical studies of Silodosin 8mg daily in BPH patients. Adverse reactions that \noccurred in at least 2 of patients treated with Silodosin and more frequently than with placebo are \nshown in Table1\nIn the two 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events were reported by \nbetween 1 and 2 of patients receiving Silodosin and occurred more frequently than with placebo: \ninsomnia, PSA increased, sinusitis, abdominal pain, asthenia, and rhinorrhea. One case of syncope in a \npatient taking prazosin concomitantly and one case of priapism were reported in the Silodosin \ntreatment group. In a 9-month open-label safety study of Silodosin, one case of Intraoperative Floppy \nIris Syndrome (IFIS) was reported.\nPostmarketing experience: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval \nuse of Silodosin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, \nit is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug \nexposure:\n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: toxic skin eruption, purpura, skin rash, pruritus, and urticaria\n Hepatobiliary disorders: jaundice, impaired hepatic function associated with increased transaminase \nvalues\n Immune system disorders: allergic-type reactions, not limited to skin reactions including swollen \ntongue and pharyngeal edema resulting in serious outcomes\nOverdose: Silodosin was evaluated at doses of up to 48mgday in healthy male subjects. The \ndose-limiting adverse event was postural hypotension. Should overdose of Silodosin lead to \nhypotension, support of the cardiovascular system is of first importance. Restoration of blood pressure and normalization of heart rate may be accomplished by maintaining the patient in the supine position. \nIf this measure is inadequate, administration of intravenous fluid should be considered. If necessary, \nvasopressors could be used, and renal function should be monitored and supported as needed. \nDialysis is unlikely to be of significant benefit since Silodosin is highly (97) protein bound.\nStorage condition\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30 ºC in a dry place.

      "drug_interactions": "drug interactions: In a drug interaction study, co-administration of a single 8mg \ndose of Silodosin with 400mg ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, caused a 3.8-fold increase in maximum plasma Silodosin concentrations and 3.2-fold increase in Silodosin exposure (i.e., AUC). \nConcomitant use of Ketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., Itraconazole, Clarithromycin, \nRitonavir) is therefore contraindicated.\nPharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions: The pharmacodynamic interactions between Silodosin and \nother alpha-blockers have not been determined. However, interactions may be expected, and Silodosin should not be used in combination with other alpha-blockers. A specific pharmacodynamic interaction \nstudy between Silodosin and antihypertensive agents has not been performed. However, patients in the \nPhase 3 clinical studies taking concomitant antihypertensive medications with Silodosin did not experience a significant increase in the incidence of syncope, dizziness, or orthostasis. Nevertheless, exercise caution during concomitant use with antihypertensives and monitor patients for possible \nadverse events. Caution is also advised when alpha-adrenergic blocking agents including Silodosin are \nco-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alphaadrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension. Carcinoma of the prostate: Carcinoma of the prostate and BPH cause many of the same symptoms. These two diseases frequently co-exist. Therefore, patients thought to \nhave BPH should be examined prior to starting therapy with Silodosin to rule out the presence of \ncarcinoma of the prostate.\nIntraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome: Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during \ncataract surgery in some patients on alpha-1 blockers or previously treated with alpha-1 blockers. This variant of small pupil syndrome is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in \nresponse to intraoperative irrigation currents; progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative \ndilation with standard mydriatic drugs; and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. Patients planning cataract surgery should be told to inform their ophthalmologist that they are taking Silodosin.\nLaboratory test interactions: No laboratory test interactions were observed during clinical evaluations. \nTreatment with Silodosin for up to 52 weeks had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen \n(PSA).\nUse in pregnancy: Pregnancy Category B. Silodosin is not indicated for use in women. An embryofetal \nstudy in rabbits showed decreased maternal body weight at 200mgkgday (approximately 13-25 times the maximum recommended human exposure or MRHE of Silodosin via AUC). No statistically \nsignificant teratogenicity was observed at this dose. Silodosin was not teratogenic when administered \nto pregnant rats during organogenesis at 1000mgkgday (estimated to be approximately 20 times the MRHE). No maternal or fetal effects were observed at this dose. Rats and rabbits do not produce glucuronidated Silodosin, which is present in human serum at approximately 4 times the level of circulating Silodosin and which has similar pharmacological activity to Silodosin. No effects on physical \nor behavioral development of offspring were observed when rats were treated during pregnancy and \nlactation at up to 300mgkgday.\nPediatric use: Silodosin is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Safety and effectiveness in \npediatric patients have not been established.\nGeriatric use: In double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week clinical studies of Silodosin, 259 (55.6) \nwere under 65 years of age, 207 (44.4) patients were 65 years of age and over, while 60 (12.9) \npatients were 75 years of age and over. Orthostatic hypotension was reported in 2.3 of Silodosin patients  65 years of age (1.9 for placebo), and 5.0 of patients  75 years of age (0 for placebo). There were otherwise no significant differences in safety or effectiveness between older and younger patients.\nRenal impairment: The effect of renal impairment on Silodosin pharmacokinetics was evaluated in a \nsingle dose study of six male patients with moderate renal impairment and seven male subjects with normal renal function. Plasma concentrations of Silodosin were approximately three times higher in subjects with moderate renal impairment compared with subjects with normal renal function. Silodosin should be reduced to 4mg per day in patients with moderate renal impairment. Exercise caution and \nmonitor patients for adverse events. Silodosin has not been studied in patients with severe renal \nimpairment. Silodosin is contra-indicated in patients with severe renal impairment.\nHepatic impairment: In a study comparing nine male patients with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh scores 7 to 9), to nine healthy male subjects, the single dose pharmacokinetics of Silodosin were not significantly altered in patients with hepatic impairment. No dosing adjustment is required in \npatients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.\nDrug interactions: Moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: The effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of Silodosin has not been evaluated. Concomitant administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., Diltiazem, Erythromycin, Verapamil) may increase concentration of Silodosin. Exercise caution and monitor patients for adverse events when co-administering Silodosin with \nmoderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors: In vitro studies indicated that \nSilodosin is a P-gp substrate. Ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor that also inhibits P-gp, caused significant increase in exposure to Silodosin. Inhibition of P-gp may lead to increased Silodosin concentration. Silodosin is therefore not recommended in patients taking strong P-gp inhibitors such \nas Cyclosporine. Alpha-blockers: The pharmacodynamic interactions between Silodosin and other \nalpha-blockers have not been determined. However, interactions may be expected, and Silodosin should not be used in combination with other alpha-blockers. Digoxin: The effect of co-administration of Silodosin and digoxin 0.25mgday for 7 days was evaluated in a clinical trial in 16 healthy males, aged 18 to 45 years. Concomitant administration of Silodosin and Digoxin did not significantly alter the steady \nstate pharmacokinetics of Digoxin. No dose adjustment is required. PDE5 inhibitors: Co-administration \nof Silodosin with a single dose of 100mg Sildenafil or 20mg Tadalafil was evaluated in a placebo-controlled clinical study that included 24 healthy male subjects, 45 to 78 years of age. Orthostatic vital signs were monitored in the 12-hour period following concomitant dosing. During this period, the total number of positive orthostatic test results was greater in the group receiving Silodosin \nplus a PDE5 inhibitor compared with Silodosin alone.

      "warnings": "Warnings and precautions: Orthostatic Effects: Postural hypotension, with or without symptoms (e.g., \ndizziness) may develop when beginning Silodosin treatment. As with other alpha-blockers, there is \npotential for syncope. Patients should be cautioned about driving, operating machinery, or performing \nhazardous tasks when initiating therapy.\nRenal impairment: In a clinical pharmacology study, plasma concentrations (AUC and Cmax) of \nSilodosin were approximately three times higher in subjects with moderate renal impairment compared \nwith subjects with normal renal function, while half-lives of Silodosin doubled in duration. The dose of Silodosin should be reduced to 4mg in patients with moderate renal impairment. Exercise caution and monitor such patients for adverse events.\nHepatic impairment: Silodosin has not been tested in patients with severe hepatic impairment, and \ntherefore, should not be prescribed to such patients.\nPharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions: In a drug interaction study, co-administration of a single 8mg \ndose of Silodosin with 400mg ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, caused a 3.8-fold increase in maximum plasma Silodosin concentrations and 3.2-fold increase in Silodosin exposure (i.e., AUC). \nConcomitant use of Ketoconazole or other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., Itraconazole, Clarithromycin, \nRitonavir) is therefore contraindicated.\nPharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions: The pharmacodynamic interactions between Silodosin and \nother alpha-blockers have not been determined. However, interactions may be expected, and Silodosin should not be used in combination with other alpha-blockers. A specific pharmacodynamic interaction \nstudy between Silodosin and antihypertensive agents has not been performed. However, patients in the \nPhase 3 clinical studies taking concomitant antihypertensive medications with Silodosin did not experience a significant increase in the incidence of syncope, dizziness, or orthostasis. Nevertheless, exercise caution during concomitant use with antihypertensives and monitor patients for possible \nadverse events. Caution is also advised when alpha-adrenergic blocking agents including Silodosin are \nco-administered with PDE5 inhibitors. Alphaadrenergic blockers and PDE5 inhibitors are both vasodilators that can lower blood pressure. Concomitant use of these two drug classes can potentially cause symptomatic hypotension. Carcinoma of the prostate: Carcinoma of the prostate and BPH cause many of the same symptoms. These two diseases frequently co-exist. Therefore, patients thought to \nhave BPH should be examined prior to starting therapy with Silodosin to rule out the presence of \ncarcinoma of the prostate.\nIntraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome: Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome has been observed during \ncataract surgery in some patients on alpha-1 blockers or previously treated with alpha-1 blockers. This variant of small pupil syndrome is characterized by the combination of a flaccid iris that billows in \nresponse to intraoperative irrigation currents; progressive intraoperative miosis despite preoperative \ndilation with standard mydriatic drugs; and potential prolapse of the iris toward the phacoemulsification incisions. Patients planning cataract surgery should be told to inform their ophthalmologist that they are taking Silodosin.\nLaboratory test interactions: No laboratory test interactions were observed during clinical evaluations. \nTreatment with Silodosin for up to 52 weeks had no significant effect on prostate-specific antigen \n(PSA).\nUse in pregnancy: Pregnancy Category B. Silodosin is not indicated for use in women. An embryofetal \nstudy in rabbits showed decreased maternal body weight at 200mgkgday (approximately 13-25 times the maximum recommended human exposure or MRHE of Silodosin via AUC). No statistically \nsignificant teratogenicity was observed at this dose. Silodosin was not teratogenic when administered \nto pregnant rats during organogenesis at 1000mgkgday (estimated to be approximately 20 times the MRHE). No maternal or fetal effects were observed at this dose. Rats and rabbits do not produce glucuronidated Silodosin, which is present in human serum at approximately 4 times the level of circulating Silodosin and which has similar pharmacological activity to Silodosin. No effects on physical \nor behavioral development of offspring were observed when rats were treated during pregnancy and \nlactation at up to 300mgkgday.\nPediatric use: Silodosin is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Safety and effectiveness in \npediatric patients have not been established.\nGeriatric use: In double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week clinical studies of Silodosin, 259 (55.6) \nwere under 65 years of age, 207 (44.4) patients were 65 years of age and over, while 60 (12.9) \npatients were 75 years of age and over. Orthostatic hypotension was reported in 2.3 of Silodosin patients  65 years of age (1.9 for placebo), and 5.0 of patients  75 years of age (0 for placebo). There were otherwise no significant differences in safety or effectiveness between older and younger patients.\nRenal impairment: The effect of renal impairment on Silodosin pharmacokinetics was evaluated in a \nsingle dose study of six male patients with moderate renal impairment and seven male subjects with normal renal function. Plasma concentrations of Silodosin were approximately three times higher in subjects with moderate renal impairment compared with subjects with normal renal function. Silodosin should be reduced to 4mg per day in patients with moderate renal impairment. Exercise caution and \nmonitor patients for adverse events. Silodosin has not been studied in patients with severe renal \nimpairment. Silodosin is contra-indicated in patients with severe renal impairment.\nHepatic impairment: In a study comparing nine male patients with moderate hepatic impairment \n(Child-Pugh scores 7 to 9), to nine healthy male subjects, the single dose pharmacokinetics of Silodosin were not significantly altered in patients with hepatic impairment. No dosing adjustment is required in \npatients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.\nDrug interactions: Moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: The effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of Silodosin has not been evaluated. Concomitant administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., Diltiazem, Erythromycin, Verapamil) may increase concentration of Silodosin. Exercise caution and monitor patients for adverse events when co-administering Silodosin with \nmoderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. Strong P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors: In vitro studies indicated that \nSilodosin is a P-gp substrate. Ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor that also inhibits P-gp, caused significant increase in exposure to Silodosin. Inhibition of P-gp may lead to increased Silodosin concentration. Silodosin is therefore not recommended in patients taking strong P-gp inhibitors such \nas Cyclosporine. Alpha-blockers: The pharmacodynamic interactions between Silodosin and other \nalpha-blockers have not been determined. However, interactions may be expected, and Silodosin should not be used in combination with other alpha-blockers. Digoxin: The effect of co-administration of Silodosin and digoxin 0.25mgday for 7 days was evaluated in a clinical trial in 16 healthy males, aged 18 to 45 years. Concomitant administration of Silodosin and Digoxin did not significantly alter the steady \nstate pharmacokinetics of Digoxin. No dose adjustment is required. PDE5 inhibitors: Co-administration \nof Silodosin with a single dose of 100mg Sildenafil or 20mg Tadalafil was evaluated in a placebo-controlled clinical study that included 24 healthy male subjects, 45 to 78 years of age. Orthostatic vital signs were monitored in the 12-hour period following concomitant dosing. During this period, the total number of positive orthostatic test results was greater in the group receiving Silodosin \nplus a PDE5 inhibitor compared with Silodosin alone. No events of symptomatic orthostasis or dizziness \nwere reported in subjects receiving Silodosin with a PDE5 inhibitor. Other concomitant drug therapy: Antihypertensives: The pharmacodynamic interactions between Silodosin and antihypertensives have not been rigorously investigated in a clinical study. However, approximately one-third of the patients in clinical studies used concomitant antihypertensive medications with Silodosin. The incidence of dizziness and orthostatic hypotension in these patients was higher than in the general Silodosin population (4.6 versus 3.8 and 3.4 versus 3.2, respectively). Exercise caution during concomitant use with antihypertensives and monitor patients for possible adverse events.\nMetabolic Interactions: In vitro data indicate that Silodosin does not have the potential to inhibit or \ninduce cytochrome P450 enzyme systems.\nFood interactions: The effect of a moderate fat, moderate calorie meal on Silodosin pharmacokinetics \nwas variable and decreased Silodosin maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) by approximately 18-43 and exposure (AUC) by 4-49 across three different studies. Safety and efficacy clinical trials for Silodosin were always conducted in the presence of food intake. Patients should be instructed to take Silodosin with a meal to reduce risk of adverse events.\nSide effect: Clinical Trials Experience: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying \nconditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly \ncompared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in \nclinical practice. In U.S. clinical trials, 897 patients with BPH were exposed to 8mg Silodosin daily. \nThis includes 486 patients exposed for 6 months and 168 patients exposed for 1 year. The population \nwas 44 to 87 years of age, and predominantly Caucasian. Of these patients, 42.8 were 65 years of age or older and 10.7 were 75 years of age or older. In double-blind, placebo controlled, 12-week \nclinical trials, 466 patients were administered Silodosin and 457 patients were administered placebo. \nAt least one treatment-emergent adverse reaction was reported by 55.2 of Silodosin treated \npatients (36.8 for placebo treated). The majority (72.1) of adverse reactions for the Silodosin \ntreated patients (59.8 for placebo treated) were qualified by the investigator as mild. A total of 6.4 \nof Silodosin treated patients (2.2 for placebo treated) discontinued therapy due to an adverse reaction (treatment-emergent), the most common reaction being retrograde ejaculation (2.8) for Silodosin treated patients. Retrograde ejaculation is reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. \nAdverse Reactions observed in at least 2 of patients: The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse \nreactions listed in the following table were derived from two 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled clinical studies of Silodosin 8mg daily in BPH patients. Adverse reactions that \noccurred in at least 2 of patients treated with Silodosin and more frequently than with placebo are \nshown in Table1\nIn the two 12-week, placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse events were reported by \nbetween 1 and 2 of patients receiving Silodosin and occurred more frequently than with placebo: \ninsomnia, PSA increased, sinusitis, abdominal pain, asthenia, and rhinorrhea. One case of syncope in a \npatient taking prazosin concomitantly and one case of priapism were reported in the Silodosin \ntreatment group. In a 9-month open-label safety study of Silodosin, one case of Intraoperative Floppy \nIris Syndrome (IFIS) was reported.\nPostmarketing experience: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval \nuse of Silodosin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, \nit is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug \nexposure:\n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: toxic skin eruption, purpura, skin rash, pruritus, and urticaria\n Hepatobiliary disorders: jaundice, impaired hepatic function associated with increased transaminase \nvalues\n Immune system disorders: allergic-type reactions, not limited to skin reactions including swollen \ntongue and pharyngeal edema resulting in serious outcomes\nOverdose: Silodosin was evaluated at doses of up to 48mgday in healthy male subjects. The \ndose-limiting adverse event was postural hypotension. Should overdose of Silodosin lead to \nhypotension, support of the cardiovascular system is of first importance. Restoration of blood pressure and normalization of heart rate may be accomplished by maintaining the patient in the supine position. \nIf this measure is inadequate, administration of intravenous fluid should be considered. If necessary, \nvasopressors could be used, and renal function should be monitored and supported as needed. \nDialysis is unlikely to be of significant benefit since Silodosin is highly (97) protein bound.\nStorage condition\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30 ºC in a dry place.

      "description": "DESCRIPTION Flumetol Easycap is a combination of Salmeterol Xinafoate and Fluticasone Propionate. Salmeterol Xinafoate is a selective, long-acting beta-2 agonist. It binds to beta-2 receptors on the smooth muscle cells that surround the airways, causing the muscle cells to relax and opening the airways. Fluticasone Propionate is a synthetic corticosteroid which is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist with mainly potent anti-inflammatory activity.  INDICATION Asthma: Flumetol Easycap is indicated for the regular treatment of asthma (Reversible Obstructive Airways Disease), where use of a combination product (bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroid) is appropriate.  This may include: n Patients on effective maintenance doses of both long-acting beta agonists and inhaled corticosteroids using separate products. n Patients who are not adequately controlled on current inhaled corticosteroid therapy. n Patients who are not adequately controlled on as needed short-acting beta-agonists, as an alternative to initiation of maintenance therapy with moderate or high doses of inhaled corticosteroid alone. Flumetol Easycap should not typically be used for the initial management of asthma, unless symptoms are severely uncontrolled, nor in patients whose asthma can be managed by occasional use of short-acting beta-2 agonists. Flumetol Easycap should not be used in the treatment of acute asthmatic symptoms.  COPD: Flumetol Easycap is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of patients with moderate to severe COPD (pre-bronchodilator FEV160 predicted normal), who have significant symptoms despite bronchodilator therapy.  DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Asthma: Patients should be given the strength of Flumetol Easycap containing the appropriate fluticasone propionate dosage for the severity of their disease. Patients should be instructed not to take additional doses to treat symptoms but to take a short-acting inhaled beta-2 agonist. Adults and adolescents 12 years and older: \nFlumetol 50100 Easycap (50 mcg salmeterol and 100 mcg fluticasone propionate): 1 Easycap twice daily. or,  Flumetol 50250 Easycap (50 mcg salmeterol and 250 mcg fluticasone propionate): 1 Easycap twice daily. or,  Flumetol 50500 Easycap (50 mcg salmeterol and 500 mcg fluticasone propionate): 1 Easycap twice daily. Children 4 years and older: Flumetol 50100 Easycap (50 mcg salmeterol and 100 mcg fluticasone propionate) twice daily. Children under 4 years of age: There are insufficient clinical data at present to recommend use of Flumetol Easycap in children aged under 4 years.  COPD: Adults: Flumetol 50250 Easycap (50 mcg salmeterol and 250 mcg fluticasone propionate) twice daily. For patients who require additional symptomatic control, replace the 50250 mcg strength with the 50500mcg strength.  CONTRAINDICATION Flumetol Easycap is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to salmeterol xinafoate, fluticasone propionate or any of the excipients. Flumetol Easycap is contraindicated in the primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required.  WARNING & PRECAUTION Use in asthma patients: Flumetol Easycap should not be initiated in patients during an exacerbation, or if they have unstable or acutely deteriorating asthma. Flumetol Easycap is not for relief of acute symptoms for which a fast and short-acting bronchodilator (e.g. salbutamol) is required. Patients should be advised to have their relief medication available at all times.  Asthma-related adverse events: Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with Flumetol Easycap. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of Flumetol Easycap. Paradoxical Bronchospasm: As with other inhalation therapy paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a fast and short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. Flumetol Easycap should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary. The pharmacological side-effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported, but tend to be transient and to reduce with regular therapy. Use in COPD patients: \nThere was an increased reporting of pneumonia in studies of patients with COPD receiving salmeterolfluticasone inhaler. Physicians should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD as the clinical features of pneumonia and exacerbation frequently overlap. Corticosteroids: Flumetol Easycap contains an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone propionate). Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods; these effects are much less likely to occur than with oral. Possible systemic effects include Cushings syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation and (very rarely) behavioral disturbances in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract and glaucoma. Therefore, it is important, that the patient is reviewed regularly and the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control is maintained..  SIDE EFFECTS As the combination inhaler contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below: Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions including rash, edema and angioedema and oropharyngeal irritation. Fluticasone Propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal edema have been reported.    PREGNANCY & LACTATION Pregnancy: Administration of Flumetol Easycap during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid. Lactation: Administration of Flumetol Easycap in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. \nThere is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.  DRUG INTERACTION Care should be taken when co administering known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., Ketoconazole, Ritonavir), as there is potential for increased systemic exposure to Fluticasone Propionate. Both non-selective and selective beta-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma, unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Due to the very low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely.  OVER DOSAGE No human over dosage data has been reported for this combination inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below: Salmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of over dosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardio selective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm. Fluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression. Monitoring of adrenal reserve may be necessary. In cases of Fluticasone Propionate overdose this combination inhaler therapy may still be continued at a suitable dosage for symptom control.  PHARMACEUTICAL PRECAUTIONS Flumetol Easycap must not be swallowed. Insert the Easycap in the Easyhaler for best performance. Remove Flumetol Easycap capsule from the blister pack just prior to use, as Easycap exposed to moisture may not tear easily. Avoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30C. Keep away from children.  COMMERCIAL PACK 1. a. Each box contains 30 Flumetol 50100 Easycap capsules in Alu-Alu blister strips. 1. b.

PREGNANCY & LACTATION Pregnancy: Administration of Flumetol Easycap during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid. Lactation: Administration of Flumetol Easycap in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. \nThere is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low.

Both non-selective and selective beta-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma, unless there are compelling reasons for their use. Due to the very low plasma concentrations achieved after inhaled dosing clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely.  OVER DOSAGE No human over dosage data has been reported for this combination inhaler; however data on overdose with both drugs are given below: Salmeterol: The signs and symptoms of Salmeterol overdose are seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, muscle cramps, dry mouth, palpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia. Other signs of over dosage may include hypokalemia and hyperglycemia. Treatment consists of discontinuation of Salmeterol together with appropriate cardio selective beta-blocking agents, which should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchospasm. Fluticasone Propionate: Acute inhalation of Fluticasone Propionate doses in excess of those recommended may lead to temporary suppression of adrenal function. This does not need emergency action as adrenal function is recovered in a few days. Chronic overdose of inhaled Fluticasone Propionate may lead to adrenal suppression.

      "side_effects": "SIDE EFFECTS As the combination inhaler contains Salmeterol and Fluticasone Propionate, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Salmeterol or Fluticasone Propionate, are given below: Salmeterol: The pharmacological side effects of beta-2 agonist treatment, such as tremor, subjective palpitations and headache have been reported but tend to be transient and reduce with regular therapy. Cardiac arrhythmia (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and extra systoles) may occur, usually in susceptible patients. There have been reports of arthralgia and hypersensitivity reactions including rash, edema and angioedema and oropharyngeal irritation. Fluticasone Propionate: Hoarseness and candidiasis (thrush) of the mouth and throat can occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Rare cases of facial and oropharyngeal edema have been reported.    PREGNANCY & LACTATION Pregnancy: Administration of Flumetol Easycap during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. There is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human pregnancy. Reproductive toxicity studies in animals, either with single agent or in combination, revealed the fetal effects expected at excessive systemic exposure levels of a potent beta-2- adrenoreceptor agonist & glucocorticosteroid. Lactation: Administration of Flumetol Easycap in breast-feeding mothers should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus or child. \nThere is insufficient experience of the use of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate in human lactation. Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low and therefore concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low. This is supported by studies in lactating animals, in which low concentrations were measured in milk. There are no data available for human breast milk.",

      "description": "Description Formocort inhaler is a pressurized metered dose inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalations only. It contains a combination of Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate BP and Budesonide BP. Formoterol is a very potent, long-acting, b2 adrenoceptor-agonist with a high intrinsic activity and a rapid onset of action. Budesonide is a potent glucocorticoid that binds with high affinity to the glucocorticoid receptor. It has a high ratio of topical to systemic activity.   Indication Treatment of Asthma: Formocort inhaler is indicated for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years of age and older. Formocort is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm.  Maintenance treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Formocort 4.5160 is indicated for the twice daily maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Formocort 4.5160 is the only approved dosage for the treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD.  Dosage and Administration Formocort should be administered twice daily every day by the orally inhaled route only. After inhalation, the patient should rinse the mouth with water without swallowing.  Asthma For patients 12 years of age and older: The dosage is 2 inhalations twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart). The recommended starting dosages for Formocort are based upon patients asthma severity. The maximum recommended dosage is Formocort 4.5160 mcg twice daily.  Improvement in asthma control following inhalation of Formocort can occur within 15 minutes, although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 2 weeks or longer after beginning treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief.   \nFor patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dose after 1-2 weeks of therapy with Formocort 4.580, replacement with Formocort 4.5160 may provide additional asthma control.  If a previously effective dosage regimen of Formocort fails to provide adequate control of asthma, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options, (e.g., replacing the lower strength of Formocort with the higher strength, adding additional inhaled corticosteroid, or initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered.   COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease): For patients with COPD the recommended dose is Formocort 4.5160 Inhaler: 2 inhalations; twice daily. If shortness of breath occurs in period between doses, an inhaled short-acting b2- agonist should be taken for immediate relief.  Contraindication The use of Formocort is contraindicated in the following conditions  l Primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD where intensive measures are required.  l Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in Formocort.  Warning and Precaution Caution should be taken in patients with diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis, untreated hypokalaemia, severe hypertension and severe cardiovascular disorders, such as ischaemic heart disease, tachycardia or severe heart failure, glaucoma and cataract, hypercorticism.   Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur, with an immediate increase in wheezing and shortness of breath after dosing. If the patient experiences paradoxical bronchospasm the medication should be discontinued immediately.   Side Effects  As the combination inhaler contains Formoterol Fumarate and Budesonide, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. There is no incidence of additional adverse events following concurrent administration of the two compounds. Adverse events, which have been associated with Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate and Budesonide, are given below:   Formoterol Fumarate: Tremor, palpitations and headache are common adverse events. Cardiac arrhythmias, muscle cramps and hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, oedema and angiooedema are uncommon and rare.  \nBudesonide: Hoarseness, candida infection in the oropharynx and throat irritation may occur in some patients. Cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, respiratory tract infections, immunosuppression, growth effect in children, glaucoma & cataract have been reported.  Pregnancy and Lactations Pregnancy category C. There is no clinical data for the use of formoterol and budesonide on exposed pregnancies are available. Budesonide is excreted in breast milk. However, at therapeutic doses no effects on the suckling child are anticipated. It is not known whether formoterol passes into human breast milk. Administration of drugs during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the foetus or child.  Drug interaction Co-administration with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) should be avoided as they may cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects. Co-administration with Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants should be with extreme caution as they may potentiate effect of formoterol on vascular system. Beta-blockers should be use with caution as they may block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. Co-administration of Formocort with diuretics should be with caution, as they may cause electrocardiographic changes andor hypokalemia associated with nonpotassium-sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists.  Overdosage The signs and symptoms of Formoterol overdose are tremor, headache, palpitations, tachycardia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, prolonged QTc-interval, arrhythmia, nausea and vomiting. Acute overdosage of Budesonide, even in excessive doses, is not expected to be a clinical problem. Chronic overdose of inhaled Budesonide may lead to adrenal suppression.

It exerts its bactericidal effect by binding to an enzyme penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) \ninvolved in bacterial cell wall synthesis. This binding results in inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis and \nsubsequent cell death. Clavulanic acid is a beta Lactamase Inhibit or. It is a suicidal inhibit or of \nbeta-lactamase enzymes from Streptomyces clavuligerus.

      "description": "Description\nGemcitabine Hydrochloride is a nucleoside analogue that exhibits antitumor \nactivity. Gemcitabine Hydrochloride is 2-deoxy-2,2-difluorocytidine \nmonohydrochloride (ß-isomer). The empirical formula for Gemcitabine \nHydrochloride is C 9H11F2N3O4 HCl. It has a molecular weight of 299.66.\nGemcitabine Hydrochloride is a white to off-white solid. It is soluble in water, \nslightly soluble in methanol, and practically insoluble in ethanol and polar \norganic solvents.",
      "composition": "Composition\nGembine Injection 1 g: Each vial contains Gemcitabine Hydrochloride USP \n1.1387 g equivalent to Gemcitabine 1 gm (as lyophilized powder).\nGembine Injection 200 mg: Each vial contains Gemcitabine Hydrochloride \nUSP 227 .74 mg equivalent to Gemcitabine 200 mg (as lyophilized powder).\nPharmacological Information\nMechanism of Action: Gemcitabine (dFdC) is metabolised intracellularly by \nnucleoside kinases to the active diphosphate (dFdCDP) and triphosphate \n(dFdCTP) nucleosides. The cytotoxic action of Gemcitabine appears to be \ndue to inhibition of DNA synthesis by two actions of dFdCDP and dFdCTP. \nFirst, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase which is uniquely responsible \nfor catalysing the reactions that generate the deoxynucleoside triphosphates \nfor DNA synthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme by dFdCDP causes a reduction \nin the concentrations of deoxynucleosides in general, and especially in that \nof dCTP. Secondly, dFdCTP competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA. \nLikewise, a small amount of Gemcitabine may also be incorporated into RNA. \nThus, the reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP potentiates the \nincorporation of dFdCTP into DNA (self-potentiation). DNA polymerase \nepsilon is essentially unable to remove Gemcitabine and repair the growing \nDNA strands. After Gemcitabine is incorporated into DNA, one additional \nnucleotide is added to the growing DNA strands. After this addition, there is \nessentially a complete inhibition in further DNA synthesis (masked chain \ntermination). After incorporation into DNA, Gemcitabine then appears to \ninduce the programmed cellular death process known as apoptosis.\nPharmacokinetic Properties\nPeak plasma concentrations (obtained within 5 minutes of the end of the \ninfusion): 3.2 to 45.5 gml. Volume of distribution of the central compartment: \n12.4 lm2 for women and 17 .5 lm2  for men (inter-individual variability was \n91.9). Volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment: 47 .4 lm2 . The \nvolume of the peripheral compartment was not sensitive to gender.  Plasma \nprotein binding: Negligible.  Systemic clearance: Ranged from 29.2 lhrm2  to \n92.2 lhrm2  depending on gender and age (inter-individual variability was \n52.2). Clearance for women is approximately 25 lower than the values for \nmen. Although rapid, clearance for both men and women appears to \ndecrease with age. For the recommended Gemcitabine dose of 1,000mgm2  \ngiven as a 30 minute infusion, lower clearance values for women and men \nshould not necessitate a decrease in the Gemcitabine dose.  Urinary \nexcretion: Less than 10 is excreted as unchanged drug.  Renal clearance: 2 \nto 7 lhrm2.  Half-life: Ranged from 42 to 94 minutes depending on age and \ngender. For the recommended dosing schedule, Gemcitabine elimination \nshould be virtually complete within 5 to 11 hours of the start of the infusion. \nGemcitabine does not accumulate when administered once weekly.  \nMetabolism: Gemcitabine is rapidly metabolised by cytidine deaminase in the \nliver, kidney, blood, and other tissues. Intracellular metabolism of \nGemcitabine produces the Gemcitabine mono, di, and triphosphates \n(dFdCMP, dFdCDP, and dFdCTP), of which dFdCDP and dFdCTP are \nconsidered active. These intracellular metabolites have not been detected in \nplasma or urine. The primary metabolite, 2-deoxy-2,2-difluorouridine \n(dFdU), is not active and is found in plasma and urine. dFdCTP Kinetics: This \nmetabolite can be found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the \ninformation below refers to these cells.  Half-life of terminal elimination: \n0.7-12 hours. Intracellular concentrations increase in proportion to \nGemcitabine doses of 35-350 mgm2 30 min, which give steady-state \nconcentrations of 0.4-5 gml. At Gemcitabine plasma concentrations above 5 \ngml, dFdCTP levels do not increase, suggesting that the formation is \nsaturable in these cells. Parent plasma concentrations following a dose of \n1,000mgm2 30 min are greater than 5 gml for approximately 30 minutes \nafter the end of the infusion, and greater than 0.4 gml for an additional hour.  \ndFdU Kinetics: Peak plasma concentrations (3-15 minutes after end of 30 \nminute infusion, 1,000mgm2 ): 28-52 gml. Trough concentration following \nonce weekly dosing: 0.07-1.12 gml, with no apparent accumulation. Triphasic \nplasma concentration versus time curve, mean half-life of terminal phase: 65 \nhours (range 33-84 hours). Formation of dFdU from parent compound: \n91-98. Mean volume of distribution of central compartment: 18 lm2  \n(range 11-22 lm2 ).  Mean steady-state volume of distribution (Vss): 150 lm2  \n(range 96-228 lm2 ).  Tissue distribution: Extensive.  Mean apparent \nclearance: 2.5 lhrm2  (range 1-4 lhrm2 ). Urinary excretion: All. \nOverall Elimination:\nAmount recovered in one week: 92-98, of which 99 is dFdU, 1 of the \ndose is excreted in faeces. \nGemcitabine and Paclitaxel Combination Therapy: Combination therapy did \nnot alter the pharmacokinetics of either Gemcitabine or paclitaxel. \nTherapeutic indications\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer:  Gemcitabine, in combination with cisplatin, is \nindicated as a first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced (inoperable Stage IIIA or IIIB) or metastatic (Stage IV) non-small cell lung \ncancer.  Gemcitabine is indicated for the palliative treatment of adult patients \nwith locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. \nPancreatic Cancer:  Gemcitabine is indicated for the treatment of adult \npatients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the \npancreas. Gemcitabine is indicated for patients with 5-FU refractory \npancreatic cancer. \nBladder Cancer: Gemcitabine is indicated for treatment of advanced bladder \ncancer (muscle invasive Stage IV tumors with or without metastases) in \ncombination with cisplatin therapy. \nBreast Cancer: Gemcitabine, in combination with paclitaxel, is indicated for \nthe treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer who have relapsed \nfollowing adjuvantneoadjuvant chemotherapy. Prior chemotherapy should \nhave included an anthracycline, unless clinically contra-indicated. \nOvarian Cancer: Gemcitabine in combination with carboplatin, is indicated for \nthe treatment of patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma who \nhave relapsed following platinum-based therapy.\nDosage & administration\nGemcitabine is for intravenous use only.\nStandard Dosing\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer: (Single-agent Use): Adults - the recommended \ndose of Gemcitabine is 1000 mgm2 , given by 30-minute intravenous \ninfusion. This should be repeated once weekly for three weeks, followed by a \none-week rest period. This four-week cycle is then repeated. Dosage \nreduction with each cycle or within a cycle may be applied based upon the \namount of toxicity experienced by the patient.\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer: (Combination Use): Adults- Gemcitabine, in \ncombination with cisplatin has been investigated using two dosing regimens. \nOne regimen used a three-week schedule and the over used a four-week \nschedule.\nThe three-week schedule used Gemcitabine 1250 mgm2, given by 30-minute \nintravenous infusion, on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle. Dosage \nreduction with each cycle or within a cycle may be applied based upon the \namount of toxicity experienced by the patient.\nThe four-week schedule used Gemcitabine 1000 mg m2, given by 30-minute \nintravenous infusion, on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Dosage \nreduction with each cycle or within a cycle may be applied based upon the \namount of toxicity experienced by the patient.\nPancreatic Cancer: Adults - the recommended dose of Gemcitabine is 1000 \nmgm2, given by 30-minute intravenous infusion. This should be repeated \nonce weekly for up to 7 weeks followed by a week of rest. Subsequent cycles \nshould consist of injections once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks out of every \n4 weeks. Dosage reduction with each cycle or within a cycle may be applied \nbased upon the amount of toxicity experienced by the patient.\nBladder Cancer:  (Single agent use): Adults - the recommended dose of \nGemcitabine is 1250 mgm2, given by 30-minute intravenous infusion. The \ndose should be given on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. This 4-week \ncycle is then repeated. Dosage reduction with each cycle or within a cycle \nmay be applied based upon the amount of toxicity experienced by the \npatient.\nBladder Cancer: (Combination use): Adults - the recommended dose for \nGemcitabine is 1000 mgm2, given by 30-minute infusion. The dose should be \ngiven on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle in combination with cisplatin. \nCisplatin is given at a recommended dose of 70 mgm2 on day 1 following \nGemcitabine or day 2 of each 28-day cycle. This 4-week cycle is then \nrepeated. Dosage reduction with each cycle or within a cycle may be applied \nbased upon the amount of toxicity experienced by the patient. A clinical trial \nshowed more myelosuppression when cisplatin was used in doses of 100 \nmgm2.\nBreast Cancer: (Combination Use): Adults- Gemcitabine in combination with \npaclitaxel is recommended using paclitaxel (175 mgm2 ) administered on \nDay 1 over approximately 3 hours as an intravenous infusion, followed by \nGemcitabine (1250 mgm2 ) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion on Days 1 \nand 8 of each 21-day cycle. Dose reduction with each cycle or within a cycle \nmay be applied based upon the amount of toxicity experienced by the \npatient. Patients should have an absolute granulocyte count of at least 1,500 \n(x106L) prior to initiation of Gemcitabine  paclitaxel combination.\nOvarian Cancer: (Combination use): Adults- Gemcitabine in combination with \ncarboplatin is recommended using Gemcitabine 1000 mgm2 administered \non days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. \nAfter Gemcitabine, carboplatin should be given on day 1 consistent with \ntarget AUC of 4.0 mgmLmin. Dosage reduction with each cycle or within a \ncycle may be applied based upon the amount of toxicity experienced by the \npatient.\nMonitoring, Dose Adjustment or Titration, Methods of Terminating Treatment \nPatients receiving Gemcitabine should be monitored prior to each dose for \nplatelet, leukocyte and granulocyte counts and, if necessary, the dose of \nGemcitabine may be either reduced or withheld in the presence of \nhaematological toxicity, according to the following scale:\nPeriodic physical examination and checks of renal and hepatic function \nshould be made to detect non-haematologic toxicity. Dosage reduction with \neach cycle or within a cycle may be applied based on the amount of toxicity \nexperienced by the patient. Doses should be withheld until toxicity has \nresolved in the opinion of the physician.\nGemcitabine is well tolerated during the infusion, with only a few cases of injection site reaction reported. There have been no reports of injection site \nnecrosis. Gemcitabine can be easily administered on an outpatient basis.\nElderly Patients\nGemcitabine has been well tolerated in patients over the age of 65. There is \nno evidence to suggest that dose adjustments, other than those \nrecommended for all patients, are necessary in the elderly, although \nGemcitabine clearance and half-life are affected by age.\nRenal and Hepatic Impairment\nGemcitabine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal \nfunction or hepatic insufficiency, as there is insufficient information from \nclinical studies to allow clear recommendation for this patient population. \nMild to moderate renal insufficiency (GFR from 30 mLmin to 80 mLmin) \nhas no consistent, significant effect on Gemcitabine pharmacokinetics.\nChildren\nGemcitabine has been studied in limited Phase I and II trials in children in a \nvariety of tumour types. These studies did not provide sufficient data to \nestablish the efficacy and safety of Gemcitabine in children.\nInstructions for UseHandling\nThe recommended diluent for reconstitution of Gembine  is 0.9 Sodium \nChloride Injection without preservatives. Due to solubility considerations, the \nmaximum concentration for Gembine  upon reconstitution is 40 mgmL. \nReconstitution at concentrations greater than 40 mgmL may result in \nincomplete dissolution, and should be avoided. To reconstitute, add 5 mL of \n0.9 Sodium Chloride Injection to the 200 mg vial or 25 mL of 0.9 Sodium \nChloride Injection to the 1 g vial. Shake to dissolve. These dilutions each yield \na Gemcitabine concentration of 38 mgmL which includes accounting for the \ndisplacement volume of the lyophilized powder (0.26 mL for the 200 mg vial \nor 1.3 mL for the 1 g vial). The total volume upon reconstitution will be 5.26 \nmL or 26.3 mL, respectively. Complete withdrawal of the vial contents will \nprovide 200 mg or 1 g of Gemcitabine, respectively. The appropriate amount \nof drug may be administered as prepared or further diluted with 0.9 \nSodium Chloride Injection to concentrations as low as 0.1 mgmL. \nReconstituted Gembine  is a clear, colorless to light straw-colored solution. \nAfter reconstitution with 0.9 Sodium Chloride Injection, the pH of the \nresulting solution lies in the range of 2.7 to 3.3. The solution should be \ninspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration, prior to \nadministration, whenever solution or container permit. If particulate matter or \ndiscoloration is found, do not administer.\nWhen prepared as directed, Gembine  solutions are stable for 24 hours at \ncontrolled room temperature 20 to 25 0C (68 to 77 0F). Discard unused \nportion. Solutions of reconstituted Gembine  should not be refrigerated, as \ncrystallization may occur. The compatibility of Gembine  with other drugs \nhas not been studied. No incompatibilities have been observed with infusion \nbottles or polyvinyl chloride bags and administration sets.\nUnopened vials of Gembine  are stable until the expiration date indicated \non the package when stored at controlled room temperature 20 to 25 0C (68 \nto 77 0F). Caution should be exercised in handling and preparing Gembine  \nsolutions. The use of gloves is recommended. If Gembine  solution contacts \nthe skin or mucosa, immediately wash the skin thoroughly with soap and \nwater or rinse the mucosa with copious amounts of water. Although acute \ndermal irritation has not been observed in animal studies, two of three \nrabbits exhibited drug-related systemic toxicities (death, hypoactivity, nasal \ndischarge, shallow breathing) due to dermal absorption. Procedures for \nproper handling and disposal of anti-cancer drugs should be considered. \nSeveral guidelines on this subject have been published. There is no general \nagreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are \nnecessary or appropriate.\nGuidelines for the Safe Handling of Antineoplastic Agents:\nCytotoxic preparations should not be handled by pregnant staff. Trained \npersonnel should reconstitute the drug. This should be performed in a \ndesignated area. The work surface should be covered with disposable \nplastic-backed absorbent paper. \nAdequate protective gloves, masks, and clothing should be worn. \nPrecautions should be taken to avoid the drug accidentally coming into \ncontact with the eyes. If accidental contamination occurs, the eye should be \nwashed with water thoroughly and immediately. \nLarge bore needles are recommended to minimise pressure and the possible \nformation of aerosols. The latter may also be reduced by the use of a venting \nneedle. \nAdequate care and precaution should be taken in the disposal of items used \nto reconstitute Gembine . Any unused dry product or contaminated \nmaterials should be placed in a high-risk waste bag. Sharp objects (needles, \nsyringes, vials, etc) should be placed in a suitable rigid container. Personnel \nconcerned with the collection and disposal of this waste should be aware of \nthe hazard involved. Waste material should be destroyed by incineration. Any \nexcess drug solution should be flushed directly into a drain with copious \namounts of water.\nOverdosage\nThere is no known antidote for overdoses of Gemcitabine. Myelosuppression, \nparesthesias and severe rash were the principal toxicities seen when a single \ndose as high as 5700 mgm2  was administered by I.V. infusion over 30 \nminutes every 2 weeks to several patients in a Phase 1 study. In the event of \nsuspected overdose, the patient should be monitored with appropriate blood \ncounts and should receive supportive therapy, as necessary.Gembine\nGemcitabine Hydrochloride USP\n13002160Side effects\nHaematological Toxicity \nBecause Gemcitabine is a bone marrow suppressant, anaemia, leukopenia, \nand thrombocytopenia can occur as a result of administration of \nGemcitabine. Myelosuppression is usually mild to moderate and is more \npronounced for the granulocyte count. While two-thirds of patients \nexperience some anaemia, only 7 have haemoglobin levels drop below 8 \ng100 mL. While 19 of patients received transfusions, only 0.2 of patients \ndiscontinued because of anaemia. The white blood cell count is depressed in \n61 of patients, however only 9 of patients experience WBCs below 2000 \ncellsmm3 and only 0.1 discontinued for leukopenia. Sixty-four percent of \npatients have reduced granulocyte counts and almost 25 drop below 1000 \ncellsmm3. Platelet counts are reduced in 21 of patients but only 5 of \npatients experience counts below 50,000 cellsmm3 and only 0.4 of patients \nwere discontinued due to thrombocytopenia. Previous therapy with cytotoxic \nagents appears to increase the frequency and severity of the leukopenia, \ngranulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia. There is no evidence of cumulative \nhaematological toxicity. Anaemia is manageable with the use of conventional \ntransfusions. Dose reduction or omission may be necessary for severe \nleukopenia or thrombocytopenia (see Dosage and Administration). Rare \ncases of haemorrhage occurring simultaneously with thrombocytopenia have \nbeen reported, but were usually thought to be disease-related. \nThrombocythemia is also commonly reported (7 .5 of patients), but no \npatients were discontinued for this event. Febrile neutropenia is also \ncommonly reported.\nHepatic Toxicity \nAbnormalities of liver transaminase enzymes occur in about two-thirds of \npatients, but they are usually mild, non-progressive, and rarely necessitate \nstopping treatment. Less than 10 of patients experience elevations greater \nthan 5 times normal and only 0.5 of patients were discontinued for \nabnormalities in liver function. One patient was discontinued for liver failure, \nbut the assessment was complicated by a history of chronic alcoholism. \nAlanine transaminase (ALT) effects decline over time despite continued \ntreatment. Elevations of alkaline phosphatase greater than 5 times normal \noccurred in 6.6 of patients but may have been due to bone disorders. \nBilirubin values greater than 5 times normal were observed in 1.5 of \npatients, but ninety percent of patients had normal bilirubin levels. \nGastrointestinal\nNausea, and nausea accompanied by vomiting are each reported in about \none-third of patients, respectively. This adverse event requires therapy in \nabout 20 of patients, is rarely dose-limiting, and is easily manageable with \nstandard antiemetics. Only 0.9 of patients report intractable vomiting and \nonly 0.9 of patients discontinued due to nausea and vomiting. Diarrhoea \nand stomatitis are commonly reported. Diarrhoea (transient to tolerable) was \nreported by 7 of patients. Intolerable diarrhoea requiring therapy was \nreported in 0.5 of patients. No patients discontinued treatment because of \ndiarrhoea. \nGenito-Urinary Toxicity\nMild proteinuria and haematuria are reported in approximately half the \npatients, but are rarely clinically significant, and are not usually associated \nwith any change in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen. However, a few \ncases (0.6 of patients) of renal failure of uncertain aetiology have been \nreported hence Gemcitabine should be used with caution in patients with \nimpaired renal function (see Precautions). Rare cases (0.4) of possible \nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome have been reported. Cumulative renal toxicity \nhas not been observed. \nPulmonary Toxicity \nDyspnoea occurring within hours following Gemcitabine injection is reported \nby approximately 10 of patients. This dyspnoea is usually mild and \nshort-lived, rarely dose-limiting, and usually abates spontaneously without \nany specific therapy. The mechanism of this toxicity is unknown and the \nrelationship to Gemcitabine is not clear. Only 0.6 of patients discontinued \ndue to dyspnoea and only 0.1 of these were believed to be \nmedicine-related. Interstitial pneumonitis has been reported infrequently.\nAllergic Toxicity\nA rash is seen in approximately 25 of patients and is associated with \npruritus in about 10 of patients. The rash is usually mild, not dose-limiting, \nand responds to local therapy. Desquamation, vesiculation, and ulceration \nhave been reported rarely. Discontinuations for cutaneous toxicity were \nreported for only 0.3 of patients. Gemcitabine is well tolerated during the \ninfusion with only a few cases of injection site reaction reported. \nGemcitabine does not appear to be a vesicant. There have been no reports of \ninjection site necrosis. Bronchospasm is usually mild and transient, but \nparenteral therapy may be required. Gemcitabine should not be administered \nto patients with a known hypersensitivity to the medicine (see \nContraindications).\nNeurotoxicity \nMild to moderate somnolence occurs in approximately 10 of patients. Only \n0.1 of patients discontinued for somnolence. Asthenia is frequently \nreported with other flu symptoms but is also reported as an isolated \nsymptom. Asthenia was cause for discontinuation by 1.4 of patients. \nParesthesias are reported in 3.4 of patients, but only 0.2 report these as \nsevere. \nFlu Symptoms\nAn entity resembling influenza is reported by approximately 20 of patients. \nThis is usually mild, short-lived, and rarely dose-limiting with 1.5 of patients \nreporting this to be severe. Fever, headache, back pain, chills, myalgia, \nasthenia, and anorexia are the most commonly reported symptoms. Cough, \nrhinitis, malaise, sweating and insomnia are also commonly reported. Fever \nand asthenia are also reported frequently as isolated symptoms. The \nmechanism of this toxicity is unknown. Reports received indicate that \nparacetamol may produce symptomatic relief. Only 0.1 of patients reported \ndiscontinuation because of the flu symptoms. The percentages of patients \nwho discontinued for fever, malaise, or myalgia are reported as 0.4, 0.3 \nand 0.1 respectively.OedemaPeripheral Oedema \nOedemaperipheral oedema is reported by approximately 30 of patients. \nSome cases of facial oedema have also been reported. Pulmonary oedema \nwas reported infrequently (1). Oedemaperipheral oedema is usually mild \nto moderate, rarely dose-limiting, is sometimes reported as painful and is \nusually reversible after stopping Gemcitabine treatment. The mechanism of \nthis toxicity is unknown. However, it was not associated with any evidence of \ncardiac, renal or hepatic failure. Oedema resulted in the discontinuation of \n0.7 of patients.\nAlopecia \nOverall, 86.7 of patients had no hair loss at all. Minimal to moderate hair \nloss was reported by 13 of patients. Only 0.5 of patients reported \ncomplete but reversible alopecia.\nOther Adverse Effects\nThe following adverse effects are also reported. Oral toxicity mainly \ndescribed as soreness or erythema occurred in 7 of patients, however this \nonly required a liquid diet in 0.2 of patients. Mild constipation is reported \nby 6 of patients. A few cases of hypotension have been reported with only \n0.1 of patients discontinued for this event. Irrespective of medicine \ncausality, some cases of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and \narrhythmia have been reported in studies. Radiation toxicity has been \nreported (see Interactions section). Hypersensitivity: anaphylactoid reaction \nhas been reported very rarely.\nCardiovascular\nHeart failure has been reported very rarely. Arrhythmias, predominantly \nsupraventricular in nature, have been reported.\nVascular\nClinical signs of peripheral vasculitis and gangrene have been reported very \nrarely. \nSkin and Appendages\nSevere skin reactions, including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions, \nhave been reported very rarely.\nInjury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications\nRadiation toxicity and radiation recall reactions have been reported. \nContraindications\nGemcitabine is contraindicated in those patients with a known \nhypersensitivity to the medicine or any of the excipients in the medicinal \nproduct.\nWarnings\nProlongation of the infusion time beyond 60 minutes and more frequent than \nweekly dosing have been shown to increase toxicity. Gemcitabine can \nsuppress bone marrow function as manifested by leukopenia, \nthrombocytopenia and anemia, and myelosuppression is usually the \ndose-limiting toxicity. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression \nduring therapy. See Dosage and Administration for recommended dose \nadjustments. Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS) has been reported rarely \nwith the use of Gemcitabine\nPregnancy: Pregnancy Category D. Gemcitabine can cause fetal harm when \nadministered to a pregnant woman. Gemcitabine is embryotoxic causing fetal \nmalformations (cleft palate, incomplete ossification) at doses of 1.5 \nmgkgday in mice (about 1200 the recommended human dose on a mgm2 \nbasis). Gemcitabine is fetotoxic causing fetal malformations (fused \npulmonary artery, absence of gall bladder) at doses of 0.1 mgkgday in \nrabbits (about 1600 the recommended human dose on a mgm2 basis). \nEmbryotoxicity was characterized by decreased fetal viability, reduced live \nlitter sizes, and developmental delays. There are no studies of Gemcitabine in \npregnant women. If Gembine  is used during pregnancy, or if the patient \nbecomes pregnant while taking Gembine , the patient should be apprised \nof the potential hazard to the fetus.\nPrecautions\nGeneral: Patients receiving therapy with Gemcitabine should be monitored \nclosely by a physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic \nagents. Most adverse events are reversible and do not need to result in \ndiscontinuation, although doses may need to be withheld or reduced. There \nwas a greater tendency in women, especially older women, not to proceed to \nthe next cycle.\nLaboratory Tests: Patients receiving Gemcitabine should be monitored prior to \neach dose with a complete blood count (CBC), including differential and \nplatelet count. Suspension or modification of therapy should be considered \nwhen marrow suppression is detected Laboratory evaluation of renal and \nhepatic function should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and \nperiodically thereafter.\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:  Long-term animal \nstudies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Gemcitabine have not been \nconducted. Gemcitabine induced forward mutations in vitro in a mouse \nlymphoma (L5178Y) assay and was clastogenic in an in vivo mouse \nmicronucleus assay. Gemcitabine was negative when tested using the Ames, \nin vivo sister chromatid exchange, and in vitro chromosomal aberration \nassays, and did not cause unscheduled DNA synthesis in vitro. Gemcitabine \nI.P. doses of 0.5 mgkgday (about 1700 the human dose on a mgm2 basis) \nin male mice had an effect on fertility with moderate to severe \nhypospermatogenesis, decreased fertility, and decreased implantations. In \nfemale mice fertility was not affected but maternal toxicities were observed at \n1.5 mgkgday I.V. (about 1200 the human dose on a mgm2 basis) and \nfetotoxicity or embryolethality was observed at 0.25 mgkgday I.V. (about \n11300 the human dose on a mgm2 basis).\nNursing Mothers: It is not known whether Gemcitabine or its metabolites are \nexcreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk \nand because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from Gemcitabine \nin nursing infants, the mother should be warned and a decision should be \nmade whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into \naccount the importance of the drug to the mother and the potential risk to \nthe infant.\nElderly Patients:  Gemcitabine clearance is affected by age. There is no evidence, however, that unusual dose adjustments, (i.e., other than those \nalready recommended in the Dosage and Administration section) are \nnecessary in patients over 65, and, in general adverse reaction rates in the \nsingle-agent safety database of 979 patients were similar in patients above \nand below 65. Grade 3  4 thrombocytopenia was more common in the \nelderly.\nGender: Gemcitabine clearance is affected by gender. In the single agent \nsafety database (N979 patients), however, there is no evidence that unusual \ndose adjustments (i.e., other than those already recommended in the Dosage \nand Administration section) are necessary in women. In general, in single \nagent studies of Gemcitabine adverse reaction rates were similar in men and \nwomen, but women, especially older women, were more likely not to proceed \nto a subsequent cycle and to experience grade 3  4 neutropenia and \nthrombocytopenia.\nPediatric Patients: Gemcitabine has not been studied in pediatric patients. \nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\nPatients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Gemcitabine should be used with \ncaution in patients with preexisting renal impairment or hepatic insufficiency. \nGemcitabine has not been studied in patients with significant renal or \nhepatic impairment.\nDrug Interactions: No confirmed interactions have been reported with the use \nof Gemcitabine. No specific drug interaction studies have been conducted.\nRadiation Therapy: Safe and effective regimens for the administration of \nGemcitabine with therapeutic doses of radiation have not yet been \ndetermined.\nConcurrent (given together or  7 days apart):\nBased on the result of preclinical studies and clinical trials, Gemcitabine has \nradiosensitising activity. In a single trial, where Gemcitabine at a dose of \n1,000mgm2 was administered concurrently for up to 6 consecutive weeks \nwith therapeutic thoracic radiation to patients with non-small cell lung \ncancer, significant toxicity in the form of severe and potentially \nlife-threatening mucositis, especially oesophagitis and pneumonitis, was \nobserved, particularly in patients receiving large volumes of radiotherapy \n(median treatment volumes 4,795 cm3). Studies done subsequently have \nsuggested that it is feasible to administer Gemcitabine at lower doses with \nconcurrent radiotherapy with predictable toxicity, such as a Phase II study in \nnon-small cell lung cancer. Thoracic radiation doses of 66Gy were \nadministered with Gemcitabine (600mgm2, four times) and cisplatin \n(80mgm2, twice) during 6 weeks. The optimum regimen for safe \nadministration of Gemcitabine with therapeutic doses of radiation has not yet \nbeen determined.\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 25 0 C in a dry place.

Dosage reduction with each cycle or within a \ncycle may be applied based upon the amount of toxicity experienced by the \npatient.\nMonitoring, Dose Adjustment or Titration, Methods of Terminating Treatment \nPatients receiving Gemcitabine should be monitored prior to each dose for \nplatelet, leukocyte and granulocyte counts and, if necessary, the dose of \nGemcitabine may be either reduced or withheld in the presence of \nhaematological toxicity, according to the following scale:\nPeriodic physical examination and checks of renal and hepatic function \nshould be made to detect non-haematologic toxicity. Dosage reduction with \neach cycle or within a cycle may be applied based on the amount of toxicity \nexperienced by the patient. Doses should be withheld until toxicity has \nresolved in the opinion of the physician.\nGemcitabine is well tolerated during the infusion, with only a few cases of injection site reaction reported. There have been no reports of injection site \nnecrosis. Gemcitabine can be easily administered on an outpatient basis.\nElderly Patients\nGemcitabine has been well tolerated in patients over the age of 65. There is \nno evidence to suggest that dose adjustments, other than those \nrecommended for all patients, are necessary in the elderly, although \nGemcitabine clearance and half-life are affected by age.\nRenal and Hepatic Impairment\nGemcitabine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal \nfunction or hepatic insufficiency, as there is insufficient information from \nclinical studies to allow clear recommendation for this patient population. \nMild to moderate renal insufficiency (GFR from 30 mLmin to 80 mLmin) \nhas no consistent, significant effect on Gemcitabine pharmacokinetics.\nChildren\nGemcitabine has been studied in limited Phase I and II trials in children in a \nvariety of tumour types. These studies did not provide sufficient data to \nestablish the efficacy and safety of Gemcitabine in children.\nInstructions for UseHandling\nThe recommended diluent for reconstitution of Gembine  is 0.9 Sodium \nChloride Injection without preservatives. Due to solubility considerations, the \nmaximum concentration for Gembine  upon reconstitution is 40 mgmL. \nReconstitution at concentrations greater than 40 mgmL may result in \nincomplete dissolution, and should be avoided. To reconstitute, add 5 mL of \n0.9 Sodium Chloride Injection to the 200 mg vial or 25 mL of 0.9 Sodium \nChloride Injection to the 1 g vial. Shake to dissolve. These dilutions each yield \na Gemcitabine concentration of 38 mgmL which includes accounting for the \ndisplacement volume of the lyophilized powder (0.26 mL for the 200 mg vial \nor 1.3 mL for the 1 g vial). The total volume upon reconstitution will be 5.26 \nmL or 26.3 mL, respectively. Complete withdrawal of the vial contents will \nprovide 200 mg or 1 g of Gemcitabine, respectively. The appropriate amount \nof drug may be administered as prepared or further diluted with 0.9 \nSodium Chloride Injection to concentrations as low as 0.1 mgmL. \nReconstituted Gembine  is a clear, colorless to light straw-colored solution. \nAfter reconstitution with 0.9 Sodium Chloride Injection, the pH of the \nresulting solution lies in the range of 2.7 to 3.3.

Caution should be exercised in handling and preparing Gembine  \nsolutions. The use of gloves is recommended. If Gembine  solution contacts \nthe skin or mucosa, immediately wash the skin thoroughly with soap and \nwater or rinse the mucosa with copious amounts of water. Although acute \ndermal irritation has not been observed in animal studies, two of three \nrabbits exhibited drug-related systemic toxicities (death, hypoactivity, nasal \ndischarge, shallow breathing) due to dermal absorption.

In the event of \nsuspected overdose, the patient should be monitored with appropriate blood \ncounts and should receive supportive therapy, as necessary.Gembine\nGemcitabine Hydrochloride USP\n13002160Side effects\nHaematological Toxicity \nBecause Gemcitabine is a bone marrow suppressant, anaemia, leukopenia, \nand thrombocytopenia can occur as a result of administration of \nGemcitabine. Myelosuppression is usually mild to moderate and is more \npronounced for the granulocyte count. While two-thirds of patients \nexperience some anaemia, only 7 have haemoglobin levels drop below 8 \ng100 mL. While 19 of patients received transfusions, only 0.2 of patients \ndiscontinued because of anaemia. The white blood cell count is depressed in \n61 of patients, however only 9 of patients experience WBCs below 2000 \ncellsmm3 and only 0.1 discontinued for leukopenia. Sixty-four percent of \npatients have reduced granulocyte counts and almost 25 drop below 1000 \ncellsmm3. Platelet counts are reduced in 21 of patients but only 5 of \npatients experience counts below 50,000 cellsmm3 and only 0.4 of patients \nwere discontinued due to thrombocytopenia. Previous therapy with cytotoxic \nagents appears to increase the frequency and severity of the leukopenia, \ngranulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia. There is no evidence of cumulative \nhaematological toxicity. Anaemia is manageable with the use of conventional \ntransfusions. Dose reduction or omission may be necessary for severe \nleukopenia or thrombocytopenia (see Dosage and Administration). Rare \ncases of haemorrhage occurring simultaneously with thrombocytopenia have \nbeen reported, but were usually thought to be disease-related. \nThrombocythemia is also commonly reported (7 .5 of patients), but no \npatients were discontinued for this event. Febrile neutropenia is also \ncommonly reported.\nHepatic Toxicity \nAbnormalities of liver transaminase enzymes occur in about two-thirds of \npatients, but they are usually mild, non-progressive, and rarely necessitate \nstopping treatment. Less than 10 of patients experience elevations greater \nthan 5 times normal and only 0.5 of patients were discontinued for \nabnormalities in liver function. One patient was discontinued for liver failure, \nbut the assessment was complicated by a history of chronic alcoholism. \nAlanine transaminase (ALT) effects decline over time despite continued \ntreatment. Elevations of alkaline phosphatase greater than 5 times normal \noccurred in 6.6 of patients but may have been due to bone disorders. \nBilirubin values greater than 5 times normal were observed in 1.5 of \npatients, but ninety percent of patients had normal bilirubin levels. \nGastrointestinal\nNausea, and nausea accompanied by vomiting are each reported in about \none-third of patients, respectively. This adverse event requires therapy in \nabout 20 of patients, is rarely dose-limiting, and is easily manageable with \nstandard antiemetics. Only 0.9 of patients report intractable vomiting and \nonly 0.9 of patients discontinued due to nausea and vomiting. Diarrhoea \nand stomatitis are commonly reported. Diarrhoea (transient to tolerable) was \nreported by 7 of patients. Intolerable diarrhoea requiring therapy was \nreported in 0.5 of patients. No patients discontinued treatment because of \ndiarrhoea. \nGenito-Urinary Toxicity\nMild proteinuria and haematuria are reported in approximately half the \npatients, but are rarely clinically significant, and are not usually associated \nwith any change in serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen. However, a few \ncases (0.6 of patients) of renal failure of uncertain aetiology have been \nreported hence Gemcitabine should be used with caution in patients with \nimpaired renal function (see Precautions). Rare cases (0.4) of possible \nhaemolytic uraemic syndrome have been reported. Cumulative renal toxicity \nhas not been observed. \nPulmonary Toxicity \nDyspnoea occurring within hours following Gemcitabine injection is reported \nby approximately 10 of patients. This dyspnoea is usually mild and \nshort-lived, rarely dose-limiting, and usually abates spontaneously without \nany specific therapy. The mechanism of this toxicity is unknown and the \nrelationship to Gemcitabine is not clear. Only 0.6 of patients discontinued \ndue to dyspnoea and only 0.1 of these were believed to be \nmedicine-related. Interstitial pneumonitis has been reported infrequently.\nAllergic Toxicity\nA rash is seen in approximately 25 of patients and is associated with \npruritus in about 10 of patients. The rash is usually mild, not dose-limiting, \nand responds to local therapy. Desquamation, vesiculation, and ulceration \nhave been reported rarely. Discontinuations for cutaneous toxicity were \nreported for only 0.3 of patients. Gemcitabine is well tolerated during the \ninfusion with only a few cases of injection site reaction reported. \nGemcitabine does not appear to be a vesicant. There have been no reports of \ninjection site necrosis. Bronchospasm is usually mild and transient, but \nparenteral therapy may be required.

Only \n0.1 of patients discontinued for somnolence. Asthenia is frequently \nreported with other flu symptoms but is also reported as an isolated \nsymptom. Asthenia was cause for discontinuation by 1.4 of patients. \nParesthesias are reported in 3.4 of patients, but only 0.2 report these as \nsevere. \nFlu Symptoms\nAn entity resembling influenza is reported by approximately 20 of patients. \nThis is usually mild, short-lived, and rarely dose-limiting with 1.5 of patients \nreporting this to be severe. Fever, headache, back pain, chills, myalgia, \nasthenia, and anorexia are the most commonly reported symptoms. Cough, \nrhinitis, malaise, sweating and insomnia are also commonly reported. Fever \nand asthenia are also reported frequently as isolated symptoms. The \nmechanism of this toxicity is unknown. Reports received indicate that \nparacetamol may produce symptomatic relief. Only 0.1 of patients reported \ndiscontinuation because of the flu symptoms. The percentages of patients \nwho discontinued for fever, malaise, or myalgia are reported as 0.4, 0.3 \nand 0.1 respectively.OedemaPeripheral Oedema \nOedemaperipheral oedema is reported by approximately 30 of patients. \nSome cases of facial oedema have also been reported. Pulmonary oedema \nwas reported infrequently (1). Oedemaperipheral oedema is usually mild \nto moderate, rarely dose-limiting, is sometimes reported as painful and is \nusually reversible after stopping Gemcitabine treatment. The mechanism of \nthis toxicity is unknown. However, it was not associated with any evidence of \ncardiac, renal or hepatic failure. Oedema resulted in the discontinuation of \n0.7 of patients.\nAlopecia \nOverall, 86.7 of patients had no hair loss at all. Minimal to moderate hair \nloss was reported by 13 of patients. Only 0.5 of patients reported \ncomplete but reversible alopecia.\nOther Adverse Effects\nThe following adverse effects are also reported. Oral toxicity mainly \ndescribed as soreness or erythema occurred in 7 of patients, however this \nonly required a liquid diet in 0.2 of patients. Mild constipation is reported \nby 6 of patients. A few cases of hypotension have been reported with only \n0.1 of patients discontinued for this event. Irrespective of medicine \ncausality, some cases of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and \narrhythmia have been reported in studies.

Gemcitabine can \nsuppress bone marrow function as manifested by leukopenia, \nthrombocytopenia and anemia, and myelosuppression is usually the \ndose-limiting toxicity. Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression \nduring therapy. See Dosage and Administration for recommended dose \nadjustments. Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS) has been reported rarely \nwith the use of Gemcitabine\nPregnancy: Pregnancy Category D. Gemcitabine can cause fetal harm when \nadministered to a pregnant woman. Gemcitabine is embryotoxic causing fetal \nmalformations (cleft palate, incomplete ossification) at doses of 1.5 \nmgkgday in mice (about 1200 the recommended human dose on a mgm2 \nbasis). Gemcitabine is fetotoxic causing fetal malformations (fused \npulmonary artery, absence of gall bladder) at doses of 0.1 mgkgday in \nrabbits (about 1600 the recommended human dose on a mgm2 basis). \nEmbryotoxicity was characterized by decreased fetal viability, reduced live \nlitter sizes, and developmental delays. There are no studies of Gemcitabine in \npregnant women. If Gembine  is used during pregnancy, or if the patient \nbecomes pregnant while taking Gembine , the patient should be apprised \nof the potential hazard to the fetus.\nPrecautions\nGeneral: Patients receiving therapy with Gemcitabine should be monitored \nclosely by a physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic \nagents. Most adverse events are reversible and do not need to result in \ndiscontinuation, although doses may need to be withheld or reduced. There \nwas a greater tendency in women, especially older women, not to proceed to \nthe next cycle.\nLaboratory Tests: Patients receiving Gemcitabine should be monitored prior to \neach dose with a complete blood count (CBC), including differential and \nplatelet count. Suspension or modification of therapy should be considered \nwhen marrow suppression is detected Laboratory evaluation of renal and \nhepatic function should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and \nperiodically thereafter.\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:  Long-term animal \nstudies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Gemcitabine have not been \nconducted. Gemcitabine induced forward mutations in vitro in a mouse \nlymphoma (L5178Y) assay and was clastogenic in an in vivo mouse \nmicronucleus assay. Gemcitabine was negative when tested using the Ames, \nin vivo sister chromatid exchange, and in vitro chromosomal aberration \nassays, and did not cause unscheduled DNA synthesis in vitro. Gemcitabine \nI.P. doses of 0.5 mgkgday (about 1700 the human dose on a mgm2 basis) \nin male mice had an effect on fertility with moderate to severe \nhypospermatogenesis, decreased fertility, and decreased implantations. In \nfemale mice fertility was not affected but maternal toxicities were observed at \n1.5 mgkgday I.V. (about 1200 the human dose on a mgm2 basis) and \nfetotoxicity or embryolethality was observed at 0.25 mgkgday I.V. (about \n11300 the human dose on a mgm2 basis).\nNursing Mothers: It is not known whether Gemcitabine or its metabolites are \nexcreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk \nand because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from Gemcitabine \nin nursing infants, the mother should be warned and a decision should be \nmade whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into \naccount the importance of the drug to the mother and the potential risk to \nthe infant.\nElderly Patients:  Gemcitabine clearance is affected by age. There is no evidence, however, that unusual dose adjustments, (i.e., other than those \nalready recommended in the Dosage and Administration section) are \nnecessary in patients over 65, and, in general adverse reaction rates in the \nsingle-agent safety database of 979 patients were similar in patients above \nand below 65. Grade 3  4 thrombocytopenia was more common in the \nelderly.\nGender: Gemcitabine clearance is affected by gender. In the single agent \nsafety database (N979 patients), however, there is no evidence that unusual \ndose adjustments (i.e., other than those already recommended in the Dosage \nand Administration section) are necessary in women. In general, in single \nagent studies of Gemcitabine adverse reaction rates were similar in men and \nwomen, but women, especially older women, were more likely not to proceed \nto a subsequent cycle and to experience grade 3  4 neutropenia and \nthrombocytopenia.\nPediatric Patients: Gemcitabine has not been studied in pediatric patients. \nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\nPatients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Gemcitabine should be used with \ncaution in patients with preexisting renal impairment or hepatic insufficiency. \nGemcitabine has not been studied in patients with significant renal or \nhepatic impairment.",

      "composition": "COMPOSITION\nGenib Tablet 250 mg: Each film coated tablet contains \nGefitinib INN 250 mg.\nPHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of the clinical antitumor action of Gefitinib is not fully characterized. Gefitinib inhibits the intracellular phosphorylation of numerous tyrosine kinases associated with transmembrane cell surface receptors, including the tyrosine kinases associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-TK). EGFR is expressed on the cell surface of many normal cells and cancer cells. \nPHARMACOKINETICS \nGefitinib is absorbed slowly after oral administration with mean bioavailability of 60. Elimination is by metabolism (primarily CYP 3A4) and excretion in feces. The elimination half-life is about 48 hours. Daily oral administration of Gefitinib to cancer patients resulted in a 2-fold accumulation compared to single dose administration. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within 10 days. \nAbsorption and Distribution\nGefitinib is slowly absorbed, with peak plasma levels occurring 3-7 hours after dosing and mean oral bioavailability of 60. Bioavailability is not significantly altered by food. Gefitinib is extensively distributed throughout the body with a mean steady state volume of distribution of 1400 L following intravenous administration. In vitro binding of Gefitinib to human plasma proteins (serum albumin and α 1-acid \nglycoprotein) is 90 and is independent of drug concentrations.\nMetabolism and Elimination\nGefitinib undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism in humans, predominantly by CYP3A4. Three sites of biotransformation have been identified: metabolism of the N-propoxymorpholino group, demethylation of the methoxy-substituent on the quinazoline and oxidative defluorination of the halogenated phenyl group. Five metabolites were identified in human plasma. Only O-desmethyl Gefitinib has exposure comparable to Gefitinib. Although this metabolite has similar EGFR-TK activity to Gefitinib in the isolated enzyme assay, it had only 114 of the potency of Gefitinib in one of the cellbased assays. Gefitinib is cleared primarily by the liver, with total plasma clearance and elimination half-life values of 595 mLmin and 48 hours, respectively, after intravenous administration. Excretion is predominantly via the feces (86), with renal elimination of drug and metabolites accounting for less than 4 of the administered dose.\nINDICATIONS\nGefitinib is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of both platinum-based and docetaxel chemotherapies. The effectiveness of Gefitinib is based on objective response rates. \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \nThe recommended daily dose of Gefitinib is one 250 mg tablet with or without food. Higher doses do not give a better response and cause increased toxicity.\nDosage Modifications\nWithhold for up to 14 days following adverse effects such as: Acute onset or worsening pulmonary symptoms (dyspnea, cough, fever)  Grade 2 ALT andor AST elevations  Grade 3 diarrhea Signs and symptoms of severe or worsening ocular disorders including keratitis  Grade 3 skin reactionsMay resume Gefitinib when adverse effect fully resolves or improves to Grade 1.\nPermanently discontinue for\nConfirmed interstitial lung disease, severe hepatic impairment, gastrointestinal perforation, persistent ulcerative keratitis.\nCo-administration with strong CYP3A4 inducers\nIncrease dose to 500 mg PO qDay in the absence of severe adverse drug reactions. Resume 250 mg qDay after discontinuation of the strong CYP3A4 inducer.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\nGefitinib is contraindicated in patients with severe hypersensitivity to Gefitinib or to any other component of Gefitinib.WARNINGS & PRECAUTIONSPulmonary ToxicityCases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) have been observed in patients receiving Gefitinib at an overall incidence of about 1. Reports have described the adverse event as interstitial pneumonia, pneumonitis and alveolitis. Patients often present with acute onset of dyspnea, sometimes associated with cough or low-grade fever, often becoming severe within a short time and requiring hospitalization. \nHepatotoxicity \nAsymptomatic increases in liver transaminases have been observed in Gefitinib treated patients; therefore, periodic liver \nfunction (transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) testing should be considered. Discontinuation of Gefitinib  \nshould be considered if changes are severe.\nINFORMATION FOR PATIENTS\nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice promptly if they develop- 1. severe or persistent diarrhea, nausea, \nanorexia, or vomiting, as these have sometimes been associated with dehydration; 2. an onset or worsening of pulmonary symptoms, ie, shortness of breath or cough; 3. an eye irritation; or, 4. any other new symptom \nSIDE EFFECTS\nThe most common adverse events reported at the recommended 250 mg daily dose were diarrhea, rash, acne, dry skin, nausea, and vomiting. The 500 mg dose showed a higher rate for most of these adverse events.\nPREGNANCY AND LACTATION\nPregnancy Category D.Gefitinib may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. A single dose study in rats showed that Gefitinib crosses the placenta after an oral dose of 5 mgkg (30 mgm\n2, about 15 the recommended human dose on an \nmgm2 basis). There are no adequate and well-controlled \nstudies in pregnant women using Gefitinib. If Gefitinib is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus or potential risk for loss of the pregnancy. For use in nursing mothers It is not known whether Gefitinib is excreted in human milk.\nUSE IN SPECIAL POPULATION\nPediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of Gefitinib in pediatric patients have not been studied. Geriatric Use:  Of the total number of patients participating in trials of second- and third-line Gefitinib treatment of NSCLC, no differences in safety or efficacy were observed between younger and older patients. Patients with Severe Renal Impairment: The effect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Gefitinib is not known. Patients with severe renal impairment should be treated with caution when given gefitinib.\nOVERDOSAGE\nThe acute toxicity of Gefitinib up to 500 mg in clinical studies has been low. In Phase 1 clinical trials, a limited number of patients were treated with daily doses of up to 1000 mg. An increase in frequency and severity of some adverse reactions was observed, mainly diarrhea and skin rash. Adverse reactions associated with overdose should be treated symptomatically; in particular, severe diarrhea should be managed appropriately.\nSTORAGE\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30C in a dry place.

In addition, expancreatic \neffects may also play vital role in the activity of Glemep  \n(Glimepiride). Administration of Glemep  (Glimepiride) can lead \nto increase sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin. After oral administration, Glemep\n (Glimepiride) is completely (100) \nabsorbed from Gl tract. When Glemep  (Glimepiride) is given with \nmeals, the mean T max is slightly increased (12) and the mean C max \nand AUC are slightly decreased. Glimepiride is completely  metabolized by oxidative biotransformation after oral dose. When \n14C-Glimepiride is given orally, approximately 60 of the total \nradioactivity is recovered in the urine in 7 days and 80-90 of the \nmetabolites are recovered in the urine.\nIndication\nNon-insulin dependent (type-ll) diabetes, whenever blood sugar levels cannot be controlled adequately by diet, physical exercise and weight reduction.\nGlemep\n (Glimepiride) is also indicated for use in combination \nwith insulin to lower blood glucose in patients whose \nhyperglycaemia can not be controlled by diet and excercise or in conjunction with and oral hypoglycaemic agent.\nDosage and administration\nIn principle, the dosage of Glemep\n (Glimepiride) is governed by \nthe desired blood sugar level. The dosage of Glemep  \n(Glimepiride) must be the lowest which is sufficient to achieve the desired metabolic control.\nThe initial and the maintenance doses are set based on the results \nof regular check of glucose in blood and urine. Monitoring of glucose levels in blood and urine also serves to detect either primary or secondary failure of therapy.\nInitial dose and dose titration:  The usual initial dose is 1 mg once \ndaily. If necessary, the daily dose can be increased. Any increase can be based on regular blood sugar monitoring, and should be gradual, i.e., at intervals of one to two weeks, and carried out stepwise, as follows: 1 mg-2 mg-3 mg-4 mg-6 mg.\nDose range in patients with well controlled diabetes: The usual dose \nrange in patients with well controlled diabetes is 1  to 4 mg daily.\nDistribution of doses: Timing and distribution of doses are decided \nby the physician, in consideration of the patients current life-style. Normally, a single daily dose is sufficient. This should be taken \nimmediately before a substantial breakfast or-if none is \ntaken-immediately before the first main meal. It is very important not to skip meals after taking the drug.\nSecondary dosage adjustment: As the control of diabetes improves, \nsensitivity to insulin increases; therefore, Glemep\n (Glimepiride) \nrequirement may fall as treatment proceeds. To avoid hypoglycaemia, timely dose reduction or cessation of Glimepiride therapy must be considered.\nA dose adjustment must also be considered whenever the patients \nweight or life-style changes, or other factors arise which cause an increased susceptibility to hypo or hyperglycaemia.\nChangeover from other oral antidiabetics to Glemep\n (Glimepiride): \nThere is no exact dosage relationship between Glimepiride and \nother oral blood sugar lowering agents. When substituting Glimepiride for other such agents, the initial daily dose is 1 mg; this applies even in changeover from the maximum dose of other oral blood sugar lowering agents. Any dose increase should be in accordance with guideline given above in initial dose and dose titration.Consideration must be given to the potency and duration of action of the previous blood sugar lowering agent. It may be necessary to \ninterrupt treatment to avoid additive effects which would increase \nthe risk of hypoglycaemia.\nAdministration: Glemep\n (Glimepiride) tablet must be swallowed \nwithout chewing and with sufficient amount of liquid \n(approximately 12 glass).\nContraindication\nGlimepiride is not suitable for the treatment of insulin dependent (type-l) diabetes mellitus, (e.g., for the treatment of diabetes with a history of ketoacidosis), or of diabetic precoma or coma. Glimepiride must not be used in patients hypersensitive to glimepiride, other sulphonylureas, other sulphonamides.\nPrecaution\nIn the initial weeks of treatment, the risk of hypoglycaemia may be increased and necessitates careful monitoring. If such risk is present it may be necessary to adjust the dosage of Gimepiride. Hypoglycaemia can almost always be promptly controlled by immediate intake of carbohydrates (Glucose or suger, e.g., in the form of sugar lumps, sugar-sweetened fruit juice or sugar-sweetened tea).\nSide effect\nHypoglycaemia, temporary visual impairment, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, urticaria, fall in blood pressure.\nDrug interaction\nPotentiation of the blood-sugar-lowering effect may occur with insulin and other oral anti-diabetics, ACE inhibitors, allopurinol, anabolic steroids and male sex hormones, chloramphenicol, coumarin derivatives, fluoxetine, MAO inhibitors, miconazole, para-aminosalicylic acid, pentoxifylline (high dose parenteral), phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, quinolones, salicylates, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, beta blockers.\nWeakening of the blood-sugar-lowering effect may occur with \nacetazolamide, barbiturates , corticosteroids, diazoxide, diuretics, \nepinephrine and other sympathomimetic agents, laxatives, \noestrogens and progestogens, phenothiazines, phenytoin, rifampicin, thyroid hormones. H 2-receptors antagonists, clonidine \nand reserpine may lead to either potentiation or weakening of the blood-sugar-lowering effect.Both acute and chronic alcohol intake may potentiate or weaken the blood-sugar-lowering action of Glimepiride unpredictably.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation\nPregnancy: Glimepiride must not be taken during pregnancy; a changeover to insulin is necessary. Patients planning a pregnancy must inform their physician, and should changeover to insulin.\nNursing mothers: Ingestion of Glimepiride with breast milk may \nharm the child. Therefore, Glimepiride must not be taken by breast-feeding women. Either a changeover or a complete discontinuation of breast-feeding is necessary.\nPacks\nGlemep\n  1 : Each box contains 3x10 tablets.\nGlemep   2 : Each box contains 3x10 tablets.\nGlemep   4 : Each box contains 3x10 tablets.\nStorageStore in a cool and dry place below 30º C. \nProtect from light.\n  Medicine:  Keep out of reach of childrenGlemep\n Glimepiride USP\nHP 5234Manufactured by\nHealthcare Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\nRajendrapur, Gazipur, Bangladesh\nKVäPok\nKVäPoKkrJAc ACFxKk\nTJptTrL CkJhJj\nKVäPok 1 : kKfKa aqJmPuPa IJPZ KVäPoKkrJAc ACFxKk 1 Ko.VJ.Ç\nKVäPok 2 : kKfKa aqJmPuPa IJPZ KVäPoKkrJAc ACFxKk 2 Ko.VJ.Ç\nKVäPok 4 : kKfKa aqJmPuPa IJPZ KVäPoKkrJAc ACFxKk 4 Ko.VJ.Ç\nKjPhtvjJ\nAjxMKuj Fr Ckr KjntrvLu j Foj cJPmKaT ßrJVLPhr (aJAk-2) ßãP FKa KjPhtKvf, KmPvwf pUj rPÜ IKfKrÜ VäMPTJPr kKroJe UJhq, mqJJo FmÄ Sj ToJPjJr oJiqPoS KjπPj IJjJ pJ jJÇ\nßp xo ßrJVLr rPÜr IKfKrÜ VäMPTJPr kKroJj UJhq S mqJJPor \noJiqPo KjπPj IJjJ pJ jJ ßx xo ßrJVLr ßãPS AjxMKuj Fr xJPg IgmJ IjqPTJj oMPU ßxmj ßpJVq cJPmKax Fr SwMPir xJPg FTP KVäPok\n ßhJ pJPmÇ\noJJ S mqmyJr KmKifôVfnJPm, rPÜ VäMPTJPr oJJ KjπPjr jq pfaáTá kPJj, ffaáTá KVäPok\n (KVäPoKkrJAc)-Fr oJJ ySJ CKYfÇ KmkJTL kKâJ KjπPj \nIJjJr jq KVäPok (KVäPoKkrJAc)-Fr TJptTrL xmtKjÕ oJJA kPJV \nTrJ CKYfÇ\nrPÜ FmÄ kxsJPm VäMPTJPr oJJr Ckr Kjntr TPr (KjKof oJJ \nkptPmãPjr oJiqPo) kJrKT FmÄ rãj oJJ KjitJrj TrJ CKYfÇ rPÜ FmÄ kxsJPm VäMPTJPr oJJ KjKof KjitJrPjr oJiqPo KYKTxJr kJAoJrL S ßxPTJrL IxlufJ KjitJrj TrJ pJÇ\nkJrKT oJJ:  xJiJre kJrKT oJJ yPò hKjT 1 Ko.VJ.

      "dosage": "Dosage and Administration of Glemep  (Glimepiride) can lead \nto increase sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin. After oral administration, Glemep\n (Glimepiride) is completely (100) \nabsorbed from Gl tract. When Glemep  (Glimepiride) is given with \nmeals, the mean T max is slightly increased (12) and the mean C max \nand AUC are slightly decreased. Glimepiride is completely  metabolized by oxidative biotransformation after oral dose. When \n14C-Glimepiride is given orally, approximately 60 of the total \nradioactivity is recovered in the urine in 7 days and 80-90 of the \nmetabolites are recovered in the urine.\nIndication\nNon-insulin dependent (type-ll) diabetes, whenever blood sugar levels cannot be controlled adequately by diet, physical exercise and weight reduction.\nGlemep\n (Glimepiride) is also indicated for use in combination \nwith insulin to lower blood glucose in patients whose \nhyperglycaemia can not be controlled by diet and excercise or in conjunction with and oral hypoglycaemic agent.\nDosage and administration\nIn principle, the dosage of Glemep\n (Glimepiride) is governed by \nthe desired blood sugar level. The dosage of Glemep  \n(Glimepiride) must be the lowest which is sufficient to achieve the desired metabolic control.\nThe initial and the maintenance doses are set based on the results \nof regular check of glucose in blood and urine. Monitoring of glucose levels in blood and urine also serves to detect either primary or secondary failure of therapy.\nInitial dose and dose titration:  The usual initial dose is 1 mg once \ndaily. If necessary, the daily dose can be increased. Any increase can be based on regular blood sugar monitoring, and should be gradual, i.e., at intervals of one to two weeks, and carried out stepwise, as follows: 1 mg-2 mg-3 mg-4 mg-6 mg.\nDose range in patients with well controlled diabetes: The usual dose \nrange in patients with well controlled diabetes is 1  to 4 mg daily.\nDistribution of doses: Timing and distribution of doses are decided \nby the physician, in consideration of the patients current life-style. Normally, a single daily dose is sufficient. This should be taken \nimmediately before a substantial breakfast or-if none is \ntaken-immediately before the first main meal. It is very important not to skip meals after taking the drug.\nSecondary dosage adjustment: As the control of diabetes improves, \nsensitivity to insulin increases; therefore, Glemep\n (Glimepiride) \nrequirement may fall as treatment proceeds.

When substituting Glimepiride for other such agents, the initial daily dose is 1 mg; this applies even in changeover from the maximum dose of other oral blood sugar lowering agents. Any dose increase should be in accordance with guideline given above in initial dose and dose titration.Consideration must be given to the potency and duration of action of the previous blood sugar lowering agent. It may be necessary to \ninterrupt treatment to avoid additive effects which would increase \nthe risk of hypoglycaemia.\nAdministration: Glemep\n (Glimepiride) tablet must be swallowed \nwithout chewing and with sufficient amount of liquid \n(approximately 12 glass).\nContraindication\nGlimepiride is not suitable for the treatment of insulin dependent (type-l) diabetes mellitus, (e.g., for the treatment of diabetes with a history of ketoacidosis), or of diabetic precoma or coma.

      "composition": "Composition\nGlymin  500 mg tablet: Each film coated tablet contains Metformin \nHydrochloride BP 500 mg.Glymin\n 850 mg tablet: Each film coated tablet contains Metformin \nHydrochloride BP 850 mg.Glymin\n XR 500 mg tablet:  Each extended-release tablet contains \nMetformin Hydrochloride BP 500 mg.\nMechanism of Action\nMetformin is a biguanide antihyperglycemic agent, which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its pharmacological mechanisms of action are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylurea, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patient with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects and does not cause hyperinsulinemia.\nGlipizide is a sulfonylurea which appears to lower blood glucose by \nstimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Extrapancreatic effects may play a part in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs.\nIndications\nGlymin\n and Glymin  XR (metformin hydrochloride extended-release \ntablets) are oral antihyperglycemic drug that is indicated in the following cases:\nG  Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or type 2 \ndiabetes, as an adjunct to diet & exercise to improve glycemic control\nG  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), as adjuvant therapy \nin combination with insulin\nG  May be used concomitantly with a sulfonylurea or insulin to \nimprove glycemic control in adults\nDosage & AdministrationMetformin (Glymin\n) should be given in divided doses (2-3 \ntimesday) with meals while Metformin extended-release tablets (Glymin\n XR) should generally be given once daily with the evening \nmeal. In both the cases it should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects \nand to permit identification of the minimum dose required for \nadequate glycemic control of the patient. Glymin\n Plus should be \ngiven once or twice daily  with meals and should be initiated at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation.\nRecommended Dosing Schedule\nAdults  The usual starting dose of Glymin\n is 500 mg twice a day \nor 850 mg once a day, given with meals. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly or 850 mg every 2 weeks, up \nto a total of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses. Patients can \nalso be titrated from 500 mg twice a day to 850 mg twice a day after 2 weeks.\nThe usual starting dose of Glymin\n XR (Metformin hydrochloride \nextended-release tablets) is 500 mg once daily with the evening \nmeal. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg \nweekly, up to a maximum of 2000 mg once daily with the evening \nmeal. If glycemic control is not achieved on Glymin  XR 2000 mg \nonce daily, a trial of Glymin  XR 1000 mg twice daily should be \nconsidered.\nPediatrics  The usual starting dose of Glymin  is 500 mg twice a \nday, given with meals. Dosage increases should be made in \nincrements of 500 mg weekly up to a maximum of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses. Safety and effectiveness of Glymin\n XR in \npediatric patients have not been established.\nContraindications\nHypersensitivity to the drug, renal impairment, diabetic coma and ketoacidosis, chronic renal diseases, congestive heart failure, trauma, \ndehydration, alcohol dependence, pregnancy, breast-feeding etc.\nPrecautions\nMetformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and \nthe risk of Metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis is increased \nwith the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus, patients with \nserum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal should not receive Metformin. In patients with advanced age, Metformin should be carefully titrated to establish minimum dose for adequate \nglycemic control, because aging is associated with reduced renal \nfunction.

Its pharmacological mechanisms of action are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylurea, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patient with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects and does not cause hyperinsulinemia.\nGlipizide is a sulfonylurea which appears to lower blood glucose by \nstimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas, an effect dependent upon functioning beta cells in the pancreatic islets. Extrapancreatic effects may play a part in the mechanism of action of oral sulfonylurea hypoglycemic drugs.\nIndications\nGlymin\n and Glymin  XR (metformin hydrochloride extended-release \ntablets) are oral antihyperglycemic drug that is indicated in the following cases:\nG  Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or type 2 \ndiabetes, as an adjunct to diet & exercise to improve glycemic control\nG  Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), as adjuvant therapy \nin combination with insulin\nG  May be used concomitantly with a sulfonylurea or insulin to \nimprove glycemic control in adults\nDosage & AdministrationMetformin (Glymin\n) should be given in divided doses (2-3 \ntimesday) with meals while Metformin extended-release tablets (Glymin\n XR) should generally be given once daily with the evening \nmeal.

      "composition": "Composition\nGraftcept Tablet 500 mg: Each film-coated tablet contains \nMycophenolate Mofetil USP 500 mg.\nPharmacology\nMycophenolate Mofetil acts by blocking purine synthesis of \nhuman lymphocytes through reversible inhibition of inosine \nmonophosphate dehydrogenase. It also inhibits proliferation \nof both T and B-lymphocytes. The mean absolute \nbioavailability of oral Mycophenolate Mofetil relative to \nintravenous Mycophenolate Mofetil was 94. Orally \nadministered radiolabeled Mycophenolate Mofetil resulted in \ncomplete recovery of the administered dose, with 93 in the \nurine and 6 in feces.\nIndications and Usage\nMycophenolate Mofetil  is indicated for the prophylaxis of \norgan rejection in patients receiving allogeneic renal, cardiac \nor hepatic transplants. Mycophenolate Mofetil should be used \nconcomitantly with other immunosuppressants.\nDosage and Administration\nRenal transplantation: In adults a dose of 1 g orally twice a day \n(daily dose of 2 g) is recommended for the use in renal \ntransplant patients starting within 72 hours of transplantation. \nAlthough a dose of 1.5 g administered twice daily (daily dose \nof 3 g) was used in clinical trials and was shown to be safe \nand effective.\nCardiac transplantation: A dose of 1.5 g bid oral (daily dose 3 g) \nis recommended for use in adult cardiac transplant patients.\nHepatic transplantation: A dose of 1.5 g bid oral (daily dose 3 g) \nis recommended for use in adult hepatic transplant patients.\nDosage Adjustments\nIn renal transplant patients with severe chronic renal \nimpairment (GFR25 mLmin1.73 m2) outside the immediate \npost-transplant period, doses of Mycophenolate Mofetil  \ngreater than 1 g administered twice a day should be avoided. \nThese patients should also be carefully observed. No dosage \nadjustments are needed in renal transplant patients \nexperiencing delayed graft function postoperatively. \nContraindications\nMycophenolate Mofetil is contraindicated in patients with a \nhypersensitivity to Mycophenolate Mofetil, mycophenolic acid \nor any component of the drug product.\nWarning and Precaution\nPatients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving \ncombinations of drugs including Mycophenolate Mofetil, as \npart of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk \nof developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly \nof the skin. Over suppression of the immune system can also \nincrease susceptibility to infection, including opportunistic \ninfections, fatal infections and sepsis.\nIn pediatric patients, no other malignancies besides \nlymphoproliferative disorder have been observed.Side Effects\nThe principal adverse reactions associated with \nMycophenolate Mofetil include diarrhea, leucopenia, anemia, \nabdominal pain, headache, sepsis, vomiting and there is \nevidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections \ne.g. opportunistic infection.\nPregnancy and Nursing Mother\nUse of Mycophenolate Mofetil during pregnancy is associated \nwith an increased risk of first trimester pregnancy loss and an \nincreased risk of congenital malformations. It is not known \nwhether this drug is excreted in human milk.\nUse in Children and Adolescents\nIn pediatric patients after renal transplantation, the \nrecommended dose of Mycophenolate Mofetil is 600 mgm2 \nbid. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients receiving \nallogeneic cardiac or hepatic transplants have not been \nestablished.\nIn general dose selection for a Geriatric patient should be \ncautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased \nhepatic, renal or cardiac function and of concomitant or other \ndrug therapy. Elderly patients may be at an increased risk of \nadverse reactions compared with younger individuals.\nDrug Interactions\nIncreased plasma concentration with acyclovir and \nganciclovir. Reduced absorption with antacids and \ncholestyramine.\nOverdose\nThe experience with overdose of Mycophenolate Mofetil in \nhumans is very limited. The highest dose administered to \nrenal transplant patients in clinical trials has been 4 gday. At \ndoses of 4 gday, there appears to be a higher rate nausea, \nvomiting andor diarrhea.\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30  0C in a dry place. \nProtect from light and moisture.",

      "description": "Description\nSodium Hyaluronate is a viscous solution consisting of a high molecular weight fraction of purified natural \nsodium hyaluronate in buffered physiological sodium phosphate. It has a pH of 6.8-7 .5. Hyaluronic acid is an important component of the bodys extracellular matrix and is present in a particularly high concentration in cartilage and synovial fluid. Endogenous hyaluronic acid provides viscosity and elasticity to synovial fluid, \nwhich is fundamental for its lubricating and shock absorbing properties. It is essential for the correct \nstructure of proteoglycans in articular cartilage. In osteoarthritis there is an insufficient amount and a \nchange in the quality of hyaluronic acid in synovial fluid and cartilage. The intra-articular administration of \nhyaluronic acid into arthritic joints improves joint functions.\nIndication\nSodium Hyaluronate is indicated for the treatment of pain in osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conservative nonpharmacologic therapy and to simple analgesics, e.g., \nacetaminophen. It may also be used as adjuvant in orthopaedic surgery.\nDosage and administration\nSodium Hyaluronate is administered by intra-articular injection. A treatment cycle consists of five injections \ngiven at weekly intervals. Some patients may experience benefit with three injections given at weekly \nintervals. Inject the full 2 ml in one knee only. If treatment is bilateral, a separate injection should be used for \neach knee. Treatment may be repeated, usually, at 6 up to 12-month interval.\nInstructions for usehandling\nSodium Hyaluronate  is for intra-articular injection and is supplied as a single use, ready to use, sterile \nsolution in a 2 ml pre-filled syringe, and must not be diluted. The content of the syringe is sterile and must \nbe used immediately once the syringe has been opened. Intra-articular injection of Sodium Hyaluronate  \nshould be made using precise, anatomical localization into the joint cavity of the knee to be treated.The injection site in the knee is determined by that location which is easier to reach. Usually a lateral approach can be followed, but in some cases a medial approach is preferable. Strict aseptic precautions \nshould be observed during the administration. The solution in the prefilled syringe is ready for use and \nrequires only a sterile disposable needle. \nA 20-gauge needle may be used on the syringe.\nTo ensure sterility, the injection site must be carefully cleansed with antiseptic. Care should be taken to expel any trapped air bubbles from the syringe containing \nSodium Hyaluronate  prior to administration.\nJoint effusion, if present, should be aspirated by arthrocentesis prior to injection of Sodium Hyaluronate. The arthrocentesis should be made using a 20 gauge needle and the joint should be aspirated to almost \ndryness, but not to a degree that would compromise the accuracy of the subsequent Sodium Hyaluronate \ninjection. The intra-articular injection of Sodium Hyaluronate can be given using the same needle as used for the arthrocentesis by simply detaching the aspirating syringe and attaching the syringe containing Sodium Hyaluronate. To make sure the needle is correctly positioned, some synovial fluid should be aspirated prior to the slow injection of Sodium Hyaluronate. If the patient experiences pain during injection, the procedure may need to be stopped.For the first hours after the injection, the patient should be advised to rest the treated knee, with as little exercise as possible, avoiding any strenuous activities or prolonged weight-bearing activities such as \njogging or tennis. Subsequently, they may gradually return to their normal level of activity. Discard any \nunused Sodium Hyaluronate.\nSide effects\nLocal reactions such as pain, swellingeffusion and warmth or redness at the injection site have been reported. Usually such symptoms are transient and disappear spontaneously within a few days by resting the affected joint and applying ice only.\nContra",

      "composition": "Composition\nHypnocum 7 .5 mg tablet: Each film coated tablet contains \nMidazolam Maleate equivalent to Midazolam BP 7 .5 mg.\nHypnocum 3 ml injection: Each 3 ml contains Midazolam \nHydrochloride equivalent to midazolam BP  15 mg.\nHypnocum 5 ml injection: Each 5 ml contains Midazolam \nHydrochloride equivalent to midazolam BP  5 mg.\nProperties and effects\nHypnocum is a sleep-inducing agent characterized by a \nrapid onset and short duration of action. It also exerts an anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxant effect.\nPharmacokinetics in special populations\nElderly:Advanced age (above 60 years) has little or no influence on the pharmacokinetics of oral midazolam.\nPatients with hepatic impairment:\nLiver cirrhosis has no effect, or may increase the absolute \nbioavailability of midazolam because of reduced \nmetabolism.\nIndications\nShort-term treatment of insomnia.Benzodiazepines are only indicated when the disorder is severe, disabling or subjecting the individual to extreme distress.Sedation in premedication before surgical or diagnostic procedures.\nDosage and administration\nOral dosage:  For adults 7 .5-15 mg daily. In elderly and \ndebilitated patients, the recommended dose is 7 .5 mg. In premedication, 15 mg of Midazolam should be given 30-60 \nminutes before the procedure.Intravenous administration:Endoscopic or Cardiovascular proceduresIn healthy adults the initial dose is approximately 2.5 mg. In case of severe illness and in elderly patients, the initial dose must be reduced to 1 to 1.5 mg.Induction of anesthesiaThe dose is 10-15 mg i.v.Intramuscular administration:\nAdult: 0.07-0.1 mgkg body weight i.m. Usual dose is about 5 mg\nChildren: 0.15-0.20 mgkgElderly and debilitated patients: 0.025-0.05 mgkgRectal administration in children:For preoperative sedation, rectal administration of ampoule solution (0.35-0.45 mgkg) 20-30 min. before induction of general anesthesia.\nContraindications\nsevere respiratory insufficiency, severe hepatic insufficiency; sleep apnea syndrome; children; use in patients with known hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines or to any component of the product; myasthenia gravis.\nPrecautions\nDependence:Use of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like agents \nmay lead to the development of physical and psychological \ndependence upon these products. The risk of dependence increases with dose and duration of treatment; it is also \ngreater in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse.\nOnce physical dependence has developed, abrupt termination of treatment will be accompanied by withdrawal symptoms. These may consist of headaches, muscle pain, extreme anxiety, tension, restlessness, \nconfusion and irritability. \nSince the risk of withdrawal phenomenarebound \nphenomena is greater after abrupt discontinuation of \ntreatment it is recommended that the dosage be decreased \ngradually.\nMidazolam i.v. should be administered very slowly.\nOverdose\nExtreme overdose may lead to coma, areflexia, \ncardiorespiratory depression and apnea. The effects of over dosage can be controlled by benzodiazepine antagonist \nflumazenil.\nPregnancy, nursing mothers\nInsufficient data are available on midazolam to assess its safety during pregnancy. Benzodiazepines should be avoided during pregnancy unless there is no safer alternative. Since midazolam passes into breast milk, Hypnocum\n should not be administered to breast-feeding \nmothers.\nUndesirable effects\nDrowsiness during the day, numbed emotions, reduced alertness, confusion, fatigue, headache, dizziness, muscle \nweakness, ataxia or double vision. These phenomena occur \npredominantly at the start of therapy and usually disappear with repeated administration.AmnesiaAnterograde amnesia may occur with therapeutic doses, the risk increasing at higher dosages. Amnestic effects may be associated with inappropriate behavior. Depression Pre-existing depression may be unmasked during benzodiazepine use. Dependence Use (even at therapeutic doses) may lead to the development of physical dependence: discontinuation of the therapy may result in \nwithdrawal or rebound phenomena. \nPacks\nHypnocum\n 7 .5 mg tablet: Each box contains 3 10s tablets \nin blister pack.Hypnocum\n 3 ml injection: Each box contains 1 5s \nampoule of 3 ml.Hypnocum\n 5 ml injection: Each box contains 1 5s \nampoule of 5 ml.  \nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30 0C in a dry place. \nProtect from light.\n  Medicine keep out of reach of children.Hypnocum\nMidazolam BP\nHP 521252Manufactured by\nHealthcare Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\nRajendrapur, Gazipur, Bangladesh",

The risk of dependence increases with dose and duration of treatment; it is also \ngreater in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse.\nOnce physical dependence has developed, abrupt termination of treatment will be accompanied by withdrawal symptoms. These may consist of headaches, muscle pain, extreme anxiety, tension, restlessness, \nconfusion and irritability. \nSince the risk of withdrawal phenomenarebound \nphenomena is greater after abrupt discontinuation of \ntreatment it is recommended that the dosage be decreased \ngradually.\nMidazolam i.v. should be administered very slowly.\nOverdose\nExtreme overdose may lead to coma, areflexia, \ncardiorespiratory depression and apnea. The effects of over dosage can be controlled by benzodiazepine antagonist \nflumazenil.\nPregnancy, nursing mothers\nInsufficient data are available on midazolam to assess its safety during pregnancy. Benzodiazepines should be avoided during pregnancy unless there is no safer alternative. Since midazolam passes into breast milk, Hypnocum\n should not be administered to breast-feeding \nmothers.\nUndesirable effects\nDrowsiness during the day, numbed emotions, reduced alertness, confusion, fatigue, headache, dizziness, muscle \nweakness, ataxia or double vision. These phenomena occur \npredominantly at the start of therapy and usually disappear with repeated administration.AmnesiaAnterograde amnesia may occur with therapeutic doses, the risk increasing at higher dosages. Amnestic effects may be associated with inappropriate behavior. Depression Pre-existing depression may be unmasked during benzodiazepine use. Dependence Use (even at therapeutic doses) may lead to the development of physical dependence: discontinuation of the therapy may result in \nwithdrawal or rebound phenomena. \nPacks\nHypnocum\n 7 .5 mg tablet: Each box contains 3 10s tablets \nin blister pack.Hypnocum\n 3 ml injection: Each box contains 1 5s \nampoule of 3 ml.Hypnocum\n 5 ml injection: Each box contains 1 5s \nampoule of 5 ml.  \nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30 0C in a dry place. \nProtect from light.\n  Medicine keep out of reach of children.Hypnocum\nMidazolam BP\nHP 521252Manufactured by\nHealthcare Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\nRajendrapur, Gazipur, Bangladesh",

Rifaximin acts by binding to the \nbeta-subunit of bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase \nresulting in inhibition of bacterial RNA synthesis.\nRifaximin is a semisynthetic, rifamycin-based non-systemic \nantibiotic. Very little of the drug will pass the gastrointestinal \nwall into the circulation as is common for other types of orally \nadministered antibiotics. Rifaximin inhibits bacterial RNA \nsynthesis by its action on the beta-subunit of the \nDNA-dependent RNA polymerase. It shows the same \nbroad-spectrum activity as rifamycin which exerts bactericidal \naction against many species of Gram-positive and \nGram-negative, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.\nIndication\nAcute Infectious Diarrhea including Travelers Diarrhea \nDiarrhea predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D)\nHepatic Encephalopathy (HE).\nDose & Administration\nRifaximin tablets can be administered orally with or without food.\nContra-indication\nRifaximin tablets are contraindicated in patients with a \nhypersensitivity to Rifaximin, any of the rifamycin antimicrobial \nagents, or any of the components in Rifaximin tablets.\nWarning and Precaution\nRenal Insufficiency:\nThe pharmacokinetics of Rifaximin in patients with impaired \nrenal function has not been studied.\nHepatic Insufficiency:\nNo dosage adjustment with Rifaximin is necessary due to its \nlimited systemic absorption. Nonetheless, caution should be \nexercised when Rifaximin is administered to patients with severe hepatic impairment.\nSide Effects\nAll medicines may cause side effects but many people have \nno or minor side effects. Common side effects of Rifaximin \ninclude dizziness, gas, headache, nausea, tiredness.\nUse in Pregnancy & Lactation\nUse in Pregnancy:\nPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and \nwell-controlled studies in pregnant women.

An additional clinical drug-drug interaction study \nshowed no effect of Rifaximin on the presystemic metabolism \nof an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and \nnorgestimate.

Avoid frequent dose \nadjustments.\nG  If the hemoglobin rises rapidly (e.g., more than 1 gdL in any 2-week \nperiod), reduce the dose of Erythropoietin alfa by 25 or more as needed to reduce rapid responses.\nG  For patients who do not respond adequately, if the hemoglobin has not \nincreased by more than 1 gdL after 4 weeks of therapy, increase the dose \nby 25.\nG For patients who do not respond adequately over a 12-week escalation \nperiod, increasing the Erythropoietin alfa dose further is unlikely to improve response and may increase risks. Use the lowest dose that will maintain a \nhemoglobin level sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. \nEvaluate other causes of anemia. Discontinue Erythropoietin alfa if responsiveness does not improve.\nFor patients with CKD on dialysis:\nG Initiate Erythropoietin alfa treatment when the hemoglobin level is less than \n10 gdL.\nG If the hemoglobin level approaches or exceeds 11 gdL, reduce or interrupt \nthe dose of Erythropoietin alfa.\nG The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 unitskg 3 \ntimes weekly intravenously or subcutaneously. For pediatric patients, a \nstarting dose of 50 unitskg 3 times weekly intravenously or subcutaneously \nis recommended. The intravenous route is recommended for patients on \nhemodialysis.\nFor patients with CKD not on dialysis:\nG Consider initiating Erythropoietin alfa treatment only when the hemoglobin \nlevel is less than 10 gdL and the following considerations apply:  The rate of hemoglobin decline indicates the likelihood of requiring a RBC \ntransfusion and,\n   Reducing the risk of alloimmunization andor other RBC transfusion-related \nrisks is a goal.\nG If the hemoglobin level exceeds 10 gdL, reduce or interrupt the dose of \nErythropoietin alfa, and use the lowest dose of Erythropoietin alfa sufficient \nto reduce the need for RBC transfusions.\nG The recommended starting dose for adult patients is 50 to 100 unitskg 3 \ntimes weekly intravenously or subcutaneously.\nZidovudine-treated HIV-infected Patients\nStarting Dose\nThe recommended starting dose in adults is 100 unitskg as an intravenous or \nsubcutaneous injection 3 times per week.\nDose Adjustment\nG If hemoglobin does not increase after 8 weeks of therapy, increase \nErythropoietin alfa dose by approximately 50 to 100 unitskg at 4- to 8-week \nintervals until hemoglobin reaches a level needed to avoid RBC transfusions \nor 300 unitskg.\nG Withhold Erythropoietin alfa if hemoglobin exceeds 12 gdL. Resume therapy \nat a dose 25 below the previous dose when hemoglobin declines to less \nthan 11 gdL.\nDiscontinue Erythropoietin alfa if an increase in hemoglobin is not achieved at a dose of 300 unitskg for 8 weeks.\nPatients on Cancer Chemotherapy\nInitiate Erythropoietin alfa in patients on cancer chemotherapy only if the \nhemoglobin is less than 10 gdL, and if there is a minimum of two additional \nmonths of planned chemotherapy.\nUse the lowest dose of Erythropoietin alfa necessary to avoid RBC \ntransfusions.\nRecommended Starting Dose\nAdults:\nG 150 unitskg subcutaneously 3 times per week until completion of a \nchemotherapy course or\nG 40,000 units subcutaneously weekly until completion of a chemotherapy \ncourse.\nPediatric Patients (5 to 18 years):\nG 600 unitskg intravenously weekly until completion of a chemotherapy \ncourse.Prevention of anemia of prematurity\nErythropoietin alfa is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3 x 250 IUkg \nb.w. per week. Treatment should start as early as possible, preferably by day 3 \nof life. Premature infants who have received a transfusion before starting \nErythropoietin alfa treatment are not likely to beneﬁt as much as infants who have not had a transfusion. The treatment should last for 6 weeks.\nDose Reduction\nReduce dose by 25 if:\nG Hemoglobin increases greater than 1 gdL in any 2-week period or\nG Hemoglobin reaches a level needed to avoid RBC transfusion.\nWithhold dose if hemoglobin exceeds a level needed to avoid RBC transfusion. \nReinitiate at a dose 25 below the previous dose when hemoglobin \napproaches a level where RBC transfusions may be required.\nDose Increase\nAfter the initial 4 weeks of Erythropoietin alfa therapy, if hemoglobin increases \nby less than 1 gdL and remains below 10 gdL,increase dose to:\nG 300 unitskg three times per week in adults or\nG 60,000 units weekly in adults\nG  900 unitskg (maximum 60,000 Units) weekly in children\nAfter 8 weeks of therapy, if there is no response as measured by hemoglobin \nlevels or if RBC transfusions are still required, discontinue Erythropoietin alfa.\nSurgery Patients\nThe recommended Erythropoietin alfa regimens are:\nG  300 unitskg per day subcutaneously for 15 days total: administered daily for \n10 days before surgery, on the day of surgery, and for 4 days after surgery.\nG  600 unitskg subcutaneously in 4 doses administered 21, 14, and 7 days \nbefore surgery and on the day of surgery.\nDeep venous thrombosis prophylaxis is recommended during Erythropoietin \nalfa therapy.\nPreparation and Administration\nG  Do not shake. Do not use Erythropoietin alfa that has been shaken or frozen.\nG  Protect syringe from light.\nG Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter \nand discoloration prior to administration. Do not use any syringe exhibiting \nparticulate matter or discoloration.\nG  Discard unused portions of Erythropoietin alfa.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproduction toxicology. Consequently:\nG  In chronic renal failure patients, Erythropoietin alfa should be used in \npregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the \nfoetus.\nG In pregnant or lactating surgical patients participating in an autologous \nblood predonation programme, the use of Erythropoietin alfa is not \nrecommended.\nIt is not known whether exogenous Erythropoietin alfa is excreted in human \nmilk. Erythropoietin alfa should be used with caution in nursing women. A \ndecision on whether to continuediscontinue breast-feeding or to \ncontinuediscontinue therapy with Erythropoietin alfa should be made taking \ninto account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of \nErythropoietin alfa therapy to the woman.\nDrug interaction\nThere are no known clinically significant drug interactions but the effect of \nErythropoietin alfa may be potentiated by the simultaneous therapeutic \nadministration of a haematinic agent such as ferrous sulphate when a \ndeficiency state exists.",

      "composition": "Composition\nIsentin-M  2.5500 Tablet: Each film coated tablet contains \nLinagliptin INN  2.5 mg and Metformin Hydrochloride BP 500 mg.Isentin-M\n  2.5850 Tablet: Each film coated tablet contains \nLinagliptin INN  2.5 mg and Metformin Hydrochloride BP 850 mg.Isentin-M\n 2.51000 Tablet: Each film coated tablet contains \nLinagliptin INN  2.5 mg and Metformin Hydrochloride BP 1000 mg.\nPharmacology\nIsentin-M\n    combines   two  antihyperglycemic   agents with \ncomplementary  mechanisms  of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: Linagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and   Metformin   hydrochloride,   a   member   of   the biguanide  class. Linagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation  of incretin  hormones.  Incretin  hormones, including glucagon-like  peptide-1  (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent  insulinotropic  polypeptide  (GIP), are  released  by the  intestine  throughout  the  day and levels are increased  in response  to a meal. These hormones  are   rapidly  inactivated   by  the   enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis.  When blood  glucose  concentrations are normal  or  elevated,  GLP-1 &  GIP  increase insulin synthesis & release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular  signaling  pathways  involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon  secretion  from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced  hepatic glucose production.  By  increasing and   prolonging   active incretin  levels, Linagliptin  increases   insulin  release &  decreases glucagon  levels in the  circulation  in a glucose-dependent manner. The pharmacologic mechanism   of  action  of  Metformin  is  different  from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption  of glucose & increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.\nIndication and  Usage\nIsentin-M\n  is  indicated   as  an  adjunct   to  diet  and exercise \nto improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes    mellitus   when  treatment    with   both Linagliptin & Metformin is appropriate.\nDosage & Administration\nThe dosage should be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerability. Maximum recommended dose of 2.5 mg Linagliptin and 1000 mg Metformin Hydrochloride twice daily with meals. Dose escalation should be gradual to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects associated with Metformin use.\nRecommended starting dose: In patients currently not treated \nwith Metformin, initiate treatment with 2.5 mg Linagliptin and \n500 mg Metformin Hydrochloride twice daily. In patients already treated with Metformin, start with 2.5 mg Linagliptin and the current dose of Metformin Hydrochloride twice daily. Patients already treated with linagliptin and metformin, individual components may be switched to this combination containing the same doses of each component.\nPrecautions\nIn a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking Metformin, the drug should be discontinued immediately and supportive therapy promptly instituted. There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue Linagliptin & Metformin. Temporarily discontinue Linagliptin & Metformin in patients undergoing radiologic studies with intravascular administration of iodinated contrast materials or any surgical procedures Isentin-M\nLinagliptin INN  Metformin Hydrochloride BP\nnecessitating restricted intake of food and fluids.

Incretin \nhormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and \nglucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are \nreleased by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are \nincreased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly \ninactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an \nendogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of \nglucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are \nnormal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis \nand release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular \nsignaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers \nglucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to \nreduce hepatic glucose production. By increasing and \nprolonging active incretin levels, Linagliptin increases insulin \nrelease and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a \nglucose-dependent manner.",

      "composition": "COMPOSITION\nJaknib Tablet 5 mg: Each ﬁlm-coated tablet contains \nTofacitinib Citrate INN 8 mg equivalent to Tofacitinib 5 mg.\nPHARMACOLOGY \nTofacitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. JAKs are intracellular enzymes which transmit signals arising from cytokine or growth factor-receptor interactions on the cellular membrane to inﬂuence cellular processes of hematopoiesis and immune cell function. Within the signaling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity including gene expression. Tofacitinib modulates the signaling pathway at the point of JAKs, preventing the phosphorylation and activation of STATs. JAK enzymes transmit cytokine signaling through pairing of JAKs (e.g., JAK1JAK3, JAK1JAK2, JAK1TyK2, JAK2JAK2).\nINDICATIONS \nTofacitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor.\nLimitations of Use: Use of Tofacitinib in combination with \nbiologic DMARDs or potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.\n Rheumatoid Arthritis:  Tofacitinib is indicated for the \ntreatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active \nrheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other non-biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Psoriatic Arthritis: Tofacitinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate or other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Ulcerative Colitis: Tofacitinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC), who have had an inadequate response or who are intolerant to TNF blockers.\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \nSwallow Tofacitinib tablets whole and intact. Do not crush, split, or chew.\nAdministration Instructions\nDo not initiate Tofacitinib if absolute lymphocyte count 500 cellsmm\n3, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1000 \ncellsmm3 or hemoglobin 9 gdL.\nRecommended Dosage Rheumatoid Arthritis- Tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily  Psoriatic Arthritis  (in combination with nonbiologic \nDMARDs)- Tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily Ulcerative Colitis- Induction Dose: 10 mg twice daily for 8 weeks; maximum 16 weeks. Discontinue Tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily after 16 weeks if adequate therapeutic response is not achieved. Maintenance Dose: Tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily. For patients with loss of response during maintenance treatment, Tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily may be considered and limited to the shortest duration, with careful consideration of the beneﬁts and risks for the individual patient.

      "composition": "Composition \nKenzo Tablet 10 mg: Each film coated tablet contains Vonoprazan \nFumarate INN 13.36 mg equivalent to Vonoprazan 10 mg.  \nKenzo Tablet 20 mg: Each film coated tablet contains Vonoprazan \nFumarate INN 26.72 mg equivalent to Vonoprazan 20 mg.  \nPharmacology\nVonoprazan fumarate is a pyrole derivative and potassium-competitive \nacid blocker (P-CAB) that competitively blocks the potassium-binding \nsite of gastric H(), K()-ATPase, a key enzyme in the process of \ngastric acid secretion.\nIndications\nIt is used for the treatment of gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, reflux \nesophagitis, prevention of recurrence of gastric or duodenal ulcer \nduring low-dose aspirin administration, prevention of recurrence of \ngastric or duodenal ulcer during non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \n(NSAID) administration  Adjunct to Helicobacter pylori eradication in \nthe following settings: Gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric \nmucosa-associated lymphatic tissue (MALT) lymphoma, idiopathic \nthrombocytopenic purpura, the stomach after endoscopic resection of \nearly stage gastric cancer, or Helicobacter pylori gastritis. \nDosage and Administration\nGastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer: The usual adult dosage for oral use is 20 \nmg of Vonoprazan administered orally once daily an 8-week treatment \nfor gastric ulcer and a 6-week treatment for duodenal ulcer. Reflux \nesophagitis The usual adult dose for oral use is 20 mg of Vonoprazan \nadministered once daily for a total of 4 weeks of treatment. If that \ndosing proves insufficient, the administration should be extended, but \nfor no longer than 8 weeks of treatment. For the maintenance therapy \nof reflux esophagitis showing recurrence and recrudescence, the dose \nfor oral use is 10 mg once daily. However, when the efficacy is \ninadequate, the dosage may be increase up to 20 mg once daily. \nPrevention of recurrence of gastric or duodenal ulcer during low-dose \naspirin administration. The usual adult dosage is one tablet of 10 mg \nof Vonoprazan administered orally once daily. Prevention of \nrecurrence of gastric or duodenal ulcer during non-steroidal \nanti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration. The usual adult \ndosage is one tablet of 10 mg of Vonoprazan administered orally once \ndaily\nAdjunct to Helicobacter pylori eradication:\nFor adults, the following three-drug regimen should be administered \norally at the same time twice daily for seven days: 20 mg dose of \nVonoprazan, 750 mg (potency) dose of amoxicillin hydrate, and 200 \nmg (potency) dose of clarithromycin. The dose of clarithromycin may \nbe increased as clinically warranted. However, dosage should not \nexceed 400 mg (potency)dose twice daily. If Helicobacter pylori \neradication with a three-drug regimen comprising a proton pump \ninhibitor, amoxicillin hydrate and clarithromycin has been \nunsuccessful, as an alternative treatment, adults should be \nadministered the following three drugs orally twice daily for seven \ndays: 20 mg dose of Vonoprazan, 750 mg (potency) dose of \namoxicillin hydrate, and 250 mg dose of metronidazole.\nContraindications\nHypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients. \nVonoprazan tablets should not be co-administered with Atazanavir & \nRilpivirine.\nPrecaution\nVonoprazan should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver \ndysfunction and severe renal impairment. Taking a proton pump \ninhibitor like Vonoprazan may slightly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, particularly when it is taken over a period of more \nthan one year.\nSide Effects\nThe most common adverse reaction was constipation, diarrhoea, skin \nrash & nausea.\nPregnancy & Lactation\nBreastfeeding not recommended during treatment, but a lactating \nwoman can pump and discard breast milk during treatment and for 2 \ndays after Vonoprazan administration.\nUse in children & adolescents\nSafety and effectiveness of Vonoprazan in pediatric patients have not \nbeen established.\nDrug Interactions\nVonoprazan is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 and \nCYP3A4. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Vonoprazan is \nnot likely to inhibit CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4. No \nclinically relevant interactions with drugs metabolized by these CYP \nenzymes would be expected. Drug interaction studies have shown \nthat Vonoprazan does not have any clinically significant interactions \nwith phenytoin, warfarin, quinidine, clarithromycin or amoxicillin. \nVonoprazan  may potentially interfere with CYP2C19, the major \nVonoprazan metabolising enzyme. Co-administration of Vonoprazan \n30 mg and diazepam, a CYP2C19 substrate has resulted in a 45 \ndecrease in clearance of diazepam. Increased plasma levels of \ndiazepam have been observed 12 hours after dosing and onwards. \nVonoprazan inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, Vonoprazan may \ninterfere with the absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an \nimportant determinant of bioavailability (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts \nand digoxin). \nCo-administration of oral contraceptives, diazepam, phenytoin, or \nquinidine do not seem to change the pharmacokinetic profile of \nVonoprazan. \nCombination Therapy with Clarithromycin\nCo-administration of Vonoprazan, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin has \nresulted in increases in the plasma levels of Vonoprazan  and \n14-hydroxyclarithromycin.\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30 º C in a dry place. Protect from \nlight and moisture.\nPacking\nKenzo Tablet 10 mg: Each box contains 3x10 tablets in Alu-Alu \nblister pack.\nKenzo Tablet 20 mg: Each box contains 5x10 tablets in Alu-Alu \nblister pack.\n  Medicine: Keep out of reach of childrenKenzo\nVonoprazan INN\n13002958Manufactured by\nHealthcare Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\nGazariapara, Rajendrapur\nGazipur-1703, Bangladesh\nDcvvb  \nKbRv UvejU 10 wg.MÖv.: cÖwZwU wdj KvUW UvejU iqQ fbvcÖvRvb \nwdDgviU AvBGbGb 13.36 wg.MÖv. hv 10 wg.MÖv. fbvcÖvRvb Gi mgZzj \nKbRv UvejU 20 wg.MÖv.: cÖwZwU wdj KvUW UvejU iqQ fbvcÖvRvb \nwdDgviU AvBGbGb 26.72 wg.MÖv. hv 20 wg.MÖv. fbvcÖvRvb Gi mgZzj\ndvgvKvjwR  \nfbvcÖvRvb wdDgviU nj GKwU cvBivj WwifwUf Ges cUvwmqvg-KwúwUwUf  \nGwmW eøKvi ( P-CAB ) hv MvwK GwmW wbtmiYi gj GbRvBg H(), \nK()-ATPase -Gi cUvwmqvg-evBwÛ s mvBUK eøK Ki\nwbkbv\nMvwK Avjmvi, wWIWbvj Avjmvi, widv GmvdvMvBwUm, jv-WvR Avmwcwib \ncÖqvMi mgq MvwK ev wWIWbvj Avjmvii cybivewË cÖwZiva, bb-iqWvj \nAvwU-BbdvgUwi WvM ( NSAID ) cÖqvMi mgq MvwK ev wWIWbvj Avjmvii \ncybivewË cÖwZiva\nnwjKvevvi cvBjvwi wbgji cvkvcvwk wbgœwjwLZ webvm eenvh: MvwK \nAvjmvi, wWIWbvj Avjmvi, MvwK wgDKvmv-múwKZ wjçvwUK wUmy ( MAL T ) \nwjçvgv, BwWIcvw_K _ªvmvBUvcwbK cyicyiv, cvKjxi GÛvvwcK \nwimKkbi cÖv_wgK MvwK Kvbmvi cÖwZiva ev nwjKvevi cvBjvwi \nMvvBwUm iva\ngvÎv I eenviwewa\nMvwK Avjmvi- cÖvßeq fbvcÖvRvbi 20 wg.MÖv. wbK WvR 1 evi 8-mßvn Ges \nwWIWbvj Avjmvii Rb 6 mßvn\nwidv BmvdMvBwUm- cÖvßeq fbvcÖvRvb WvR  nj 20 wg.MÖv. wbK 1 evi Ki \ngvU 4 mßvn Ze Kvb Kvb Î 8 mßvnKvj chšÍ wPwKrmv cÖqvRb nZ cvi    \nwidv BmvdMvBwUm cybivewË Ges cÖvyfvei gBbUbvÝ _ivwci Î mvaviY \nWvR nj 10 wg.MÖv. wbK 1 evi  Ze Kvb Kvb Î 20 wg.MÖv. wbK 1 evi \nchšÍ wPwKrmv cÖqvRb nZ cvi    \njv-WvR Avmwcwib cÖqvMi Î MvwK ev wWIWbvj Avjmvii cybivewË I \ncÖwZiva  cÖvßeq  fbvcÖvRb  WvR nj wg.MÖv. wbK 1 evi \nbb-iqWvj GwUBbdvgvUwi WvM ( NSAID ) cÖqvMi mgq MvwK ev \nwWIWbvj Avjmvii cybivewË cÖwZiva  Gi Î mvaviY cÖvßeq WvR nj 10 \nwg.MÖv. wbK 1 evi \nnwjKvevi cvBjvwi wbgji Gi Î fbvcÖvRv bi mvaviY WvR:  \nfbvcÖvRvb  20   wg.MÖv. wbK 2 evi 7 wb \nGgvwwmwjb 750 wg.MÖv. wbK 2 evi 7 wb \nKvwi_ªvgvBwmb 200 wg.MÖv. wbK 2 evi 7 wb \nZe Kvb Kvb Î Kvwi_ªvgvBwmb WvR 400 wg.MÖv. wbK 2 evi chšÍ     \ncÖqvM gvÎv wbaviY Kiv hZ cvi\nnwjKvevi cvBjvwi wbgji Î Dciv³ wUcj _ivwc wedj nj weKí \nwPwKrmv-  \nfbvcÖvRv b 20   wg.MÖv. wbK 2 evi 7 wb \nGgvwwmwjb 750 wg.MÖv. wbK 2 evi 7 wb \ngUvwbWvRj 200 wg.MÖv. wbK 2 evi 7 wb \ncÖwZwbkbv \nfbvcÖvRv b Gi cÖwZ AwZmsebkxj ivMxi Î Gi eenvi cwinvi Kiv DwPZ   \nmveavbZv\nfbvcÖvRv b VqJKˆsT IJuxJPr mqmyJPrr kNPmt ImvqA oqJKuV&jqJj&Kxr xJmqfJ pJYJA \nTPr KjPf yPmÇ fJ jJ yPu fbvcÖvRv b ßrJPVr uãexoNyPT ßdPT KhP ßrJV \nKjkPe Kmu WaJPf kJPrÇ \ncvkcÖwZwµqv  \nmePq ewk h mKj wecixZ cÖwZwµqv nq _vK mjv nj KvôKvwVb, \nWvqwiqv, ZKi dymKzwo Ges ewg ewg fve  Mfvev I ÍbvbKvjxb Aev  \nwPwKrmvi mgq eyKi ya LvIqvbv evÃbxq bq, Ze GKRb ÍbvbKvix gwnjvi \nfbvcÖvRvb cÖqvMi cieZx 2 wb eyKi ya cvú Ki dj wZ ne\ncwWqvwUK eenvi\ncwWqvwUK Giga fbvcÖvRvbi wbivcËv Ges KvhKvwiZv  cÖwZwôZ nqwb\nAb Ilyai mv_ cÖwZwµqv\nfbvcÖvRvb mqmyJPrr xo ßlKjaPj, SJrPlKrj, TáAKjKcj, TîqJKrPgsJoJAKxj, \nFPoJKéKxKuj Fr KogKJr ßTJj koJe jJAÇ fPm cJJKkJPor xJPg fbvcÖvRvb  \nmqmyJPrr ßãP cJJKkJPor Kjxre kKâJ Kmu yPf kJPrÇ fbvcÖvRvb  \nKTPaJPTJjJu, KcPVJKéj FmÄ ßuRy JfL SwMPir ßvJwPer ßãP mJiJ xOKÓ \nTrPf kJPrÇ \nmsiY\nÊÏ JPj AbwaK 30 ºßx. fJkoJJ xÄrãe KiZ neÇ IJPuJ FmÄ IJhsftJ ßgPT \nhNPr rJUMjÇ\nmievin\nKbRv UvejU 10 wg.MÖv.: kKfKa mJPé  iqQ 3X10 Ka aqJmPua Avjy-Avjy \nweøvi cvK-G  Ç\nKbRv UvejU 20 wg.MÖv.: kKfKa mJPé  iqQ 5 X10 Ka aqJmPua Avjy-Avjy \nweøvi cvK-G  Ç\n  xTu kTJr SwMi KvÊPhr jJVJPur mJAPr rJUMjÇ\n     KbR v\nfbvcÖvRvb AvBGbGb\nkáfTJrT\nßyug&PTJr lJotJKxCKaTqJux KuKoPac\nMRvwiqvcvov, ivRªcyi\nVJLkMr-1703, mJÄuJPhv",

      "composition": "COMPOSITION\nLaxante Tablet 10 mg: Each tablet contains Sodium Picosulfate BP \n10 mg.\nPHARMACOLOGY \nSodium Picosulfate is a triarylmethane group derivative stimulant \nlaxative. After oral administration it is activated by the colonic bacteria \nand acts locally in the colon. The active form then stimulates the \nnerve endings of the intestinal wall and results in colonic peristalsis \nwith promotion of accumulation of water and electrolytes in the \ncolonic lumen. This results in stimulation of defecation, reduction of \ntransit time and softening of the stool. Stimulation of the rectum \ncauses increased motility and a feeling of rectal fullness. The rectal \neffect may help to restore the call to stool.\nINDICATIONS  \nSodium Picosulfate is indicated in the following conditions \n Constipation of any etiology  \n Relief from prolonged & recurrent constipation\n Bowel clearance before surgery, childbirth or radiological investigations.\nDOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION  \nFor oral administration. The following dosages are recommended to \nbe taken at night to produce evacuation the following morning. It is \nrecommended to start with the lowest dose. The dose may be \nadjusted up to the maximum recommended dose to produce regular \nstools. The maximum recommended daily dose should not be \nexceeded:\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\nIleus or intestinal obstruction, severe painful andor feverish acute \nabdominal conditions (e.g. appendicitis) potentially associated with \nnausea and vomiting, acute inflammatory bowel diseases, severe \ndehydration, known hypersensitivity to Sodium Picosulfate or any \nother component of the product.\nPRECAUTIONS & WARNINGS  \nProlonged excessive use may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalance \nand hypokalemia. Harmful for those suffering from alcoholism. To be \ntaken into account in pregnant or breast-feeding women, children \nand high-risk groups such as patients with liver disease or epilepsy.\nSIDE EFFECTS  \nHypersensitivity, dizziness, syncope, vasovagal response, gastrointestinal \ndisorders, diarrhea, abdominal pain and abdominal cramps, nausea, \nvomiting.PREGNANCY & LACTATION \nThere are no reports of undesirable or damaging effects during \npregnancy or to the foetus attributable to the use of this product. Use \nof the drug should be avoided during the first trimester. Clinical data \nshow that neither the active moiety of sodium Picosulfate (BHPM or \nbis-(p  hydroxyphenyl)-pyridyl-2-methane) nor its glucuronides are \nexcreted into the milk of healthy lactating females.\nDRUG INTERACTIONS  \nThe concomitant use of diuretics or adreno corticosteroids may \nincrease the risk of electrolyte imbalance if excessive doses are taken. \nConcurrent administration of antibiotics may reduce the laxative \naction of this product.\nOVERDOSE\nLaxatives when taken in chronic overdosage may cause chronic \ndiarrhea, abdominal pain, hypokalemia, secondary \nhyperaldosteronism, and renal calculi. Renal tubular damage, \nmetabolic alkalosis, and muscle weakness secondary to hypokalemia \nhave also been described in association with chronic laxative abuse.\nSTORAGE CONDITION\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30 0 C in a dry place.

      "composition": "Composition\nLaxur Plus- Each film coated tablet contains \nFurosemide BP 40 mg and Spironolactone BP 50 mg.\nProperties & Effects\nLaxur Plus is a combination diuretic containing a \nloop diuretic, Furosemide and a potassium sparing \ndiuretic, Spironolactone. Spironolactone and \nFurosemide  have different but complementary \nmechanisms and sites of action. Therefore, when \ngiven together they produce synergistic or additive \ndiuretic effects. The Furosemide component inhibits \nthe NaK2Cl- cotransporter in the ascending Loop \nof Henle and blocks the reabsorption of sodium, \npotassium and chloride ions thereby increasing the \nquantity of sodium and the volume of water excreted \nin the urine. This characteristically induces potassium \nloss. The Spironolactone component inhibits the \nreabsorption of sodium in exchange for potassium at \nthe distal tubule by antagonizing the action of \naldosterone so that sodium excretion is greatly \nfavored and the excess loss of potassium, induced by \nthe Furosemide, is reduced.\nPharmacokinetics\nFurosemide: Furosemide  is a short-acting diuretic; \ndiuresis usually commences within one hour and \nlasts for four to six hours.\nSpironolactone:  Spironolactone, a competitive \ninhibitor of aldosterone, increases sodium excretion \nby reducing potassium loss at the distal renal tubule. \nIt has a slow and prolonged action, maximum \nresponse being usually attained after 2-3 days \ntreatment.\nIndications\nLaxur Plus is indicated for the treatment of\nl  Essential hypertension\nl  Congestive heart failure\nl Liver cirrhosis, with collection of fluid in the  \nabdominal cavity (ascites)\nl  Swelling due to excess fluid retention (edema)\nl Overproduction of aldosterone \n(hyperaldosteronism)\nDosage and Administration\nLaxur Plus: 1 to 2 tablets daily (50 to 100 mg of \nSpironolactone and 40 to 80 mg of Furosemide) for \npatients previously stabilised with higher doses of \nSpironolactone and Furosemide.\nContraindications\nLaxur Plus is contraindicated in acute renal \ninsufficiency, anuria, hyperkalemia and in patients \nwith a history of hypersensitivity to Furosemide or \nSpironolactone.\nWarning and Precautions\nIt is recommended that individuals taking this \nmedicine have their fluid and salt (electrolyte) balance monitored regularly.\nLaxur Plus should be used with caution in diabetes, \nenlarged prostate (prostatic hypertrophy), hypotension, \nlow volume of circulating blood (hypovolemia).\nSide Effects\nAdverse reactions that are known to be associated\nwith Laxur Plus are fatigue, blood disorders, skin \nrashes, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, \nabdominal pain, hyperglycemia, hypotension, \nabnormal enlargement of breasts in the male \n(gynecomastia), irregular menstrual cycle, \ndisturbances in the levels of electrolytes in the blood.\nPregnancy and Lactation\nLaxur Plus should be used with caution during \npregnancy and only if the expected benefit to the \nmother is greater than the possible risk to the fetus.\nLaxur Plus passes into breast milk. It is \nrecommended that mothers should avoid using this \nmedicine while breast-feeding.\nDrug Interactions\nl When taken together with ACE inhibitors or \npotassium salts there is an increased risk of  \nhyperkalemia.\nl Spironolactone increases the levels of \ncardiacglycosides such as digoxin in the blood.\nl Spironolactone decreases the ulcer healing  effects \nof carbenoxolone.\nl Corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone may also \ncause potassium loss and severe depletion may  \noccur if they are used with Furosemide.\nl When taken together with drugs that decrease  \nblood pressure there is an increased risk of a  \nlarge drop in blood pressure and fainting,  \nespecially when given with the first dose of ACE  \ninhibitors (e.g. captopril).\nl The blood pressure lowering and diuretic effects of \nFrusemide may be reduced or abolished when  used \ntogether with indomethacin and possibly  other \nnon-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs  (NSAIDs).\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30 o C in a dry place. \nProtect from light & moisture.\nPackaging\nLaxur Plus : Each box containing 3x10 tablets in \nblister pack.\n  Medicine: keep out of reach of children\n13001327Manufactured by\nHealthcare Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\nGazariapara, Rajendrapur\nGazipur-1703, Bangladesh",

This characteristically induces potassium loss. \nThe Spironolactone component inhibits the \nreabsorption of sodium in exchange for potassium at \nthe distal tubule by antagonizing the action of \naldosterone so that sodium excretion is greatly \nfavored and the excess loss of potassium, induced by \nthe Frusemide, is reduced.\nPharmacokinetics\nFrusemide: Frusemide is a short-acting diuretic; \ndiuresis usually commences within one hour and \nlasts for four to six hours.\nSpironolactone: Spironolactone, a competitive \ninhibitor of aldosterone, increases sodium excretion \nby reducing potassium loss at the distal renal tubule. \nIt has a slow and prolonged action, maximum \nresponse being usually attained after 2-3 days \ntreatment.\nIndications\nLaxur is indicated for the treatment of\n  Essential hypertension\n  Congestive heart failure\n Liver cirrhosis, with collection of fluid in the  \t\t  \nabdominal cavity (ascites)\n  Swelling due to excess fluid retention (edema)\n Overproduction of aldosterone \n(hyperaldosteronism)\nDosage and Administration\n1 to 4 tablets daily (50 to 200 mg of Spironolactone \nand 20 to 80 mg of Frusemide) according to the \npatients response.\nAdverse Reactions\nAdverse reactions that are known to be associated\nwith Laxur are fatigue, blood disorders, skin rashes, \ndiarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal \npain, hyperglycemia, hypotension, abnormal \nenlargement of breasts in the male ( gynecomastia), \nirregular menstrual cycle, disturbances in the levels \nof electrolytes in the blood.\nContraindications\nLaxur is contraindicated in acute renal insufficiency, anuria, hyperkalemia and in patients with a history of \nhypersensitivity to Frusemide or Spironolactone.\nPrecautions\nIt is recommended that individuals taking this \nmedicine have their fluid and salt (electrolyte) \nbalance monitored regularly.\nLaxur should be used with caution in diabetes, \nenlarged prostate (prostatic hypertrophy), \nhypotension, low volume of circulating blood \n(hypovolemia).\nPregnancy and Lactation\nLaxur should be used with caution during \npregnancy and only if the expected benefit to the \nmother is greater than the possible risk to the fetus.\nLaxur passes into breast milk.

      "composition": "Composition\nLeptal 300 mg: Each tablet contains Oxcarbazepine USP 300 mg\nLeptal 600 mg: Each tablet contains Oxcarbazepine USP 600 mg \nPharmacology\nThe pharmacological activity of Oxcarbazepine is primarily exerted \nthrough the 10-monohydroxy metabolite (MHD). The precise \nmechanism by which Oxcarbazepine and MHD exert their antiseizure \neffect is unknown; however, in vitro electrophysiological studies \nindicate that they produce blockade of voltage-sensitive sodium \nchannels, resulting in stabilization of hyperexcited neural \nmembranes, inhibition of repetitive neuronal firing, and diminution of \npropagation of synaptic impulses. These actions are thought to be \nimportant in the prevention of seizure spread in the intact brain. In \naddition, increased potassium conductance and modulation of high \nvoltage activated calcium channels may contribute to the \nanticonvulsant effects of the drug. No significant interactions of \nOxcarbazepine or MHD with brain neurotransmitter or modulator \nreceptor sites have been demonstrated. \nIndication\nLeptal is indicated for: \n Adults: Monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in the treatment of \npartial seizures \n Pediatrics:\n- Monotherapy in the treatment of partial seizures in children 416 \nyears\n- Adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures in children \n216 years \nDosage & Administration\nAdults: initiate with a dose of 600 mgday, given twice-a-day \n Adjunctive Therapy: Maximum increment of 600 mgday at \napproximately weekly intervals. The recommended daily dose is 1200 \nmgday \n Conversion to Monotherapy: withdrawal concomitant over 3 to 6 \nweeks; reach maximum dose in 2 to 4 weeks with increments of 600 \nmgday at weekly intervals to a recommended daily dose of 2400 \nmgday\n Initiation of Monotherapy: Increments of 300 mgday every third \nday to a dose of 1200 mgday. \n Initiate at one-half the usual starting dose and increase slowly in \npatients with a creatinine clearance 30 mLmin.\nPediatrics: initiation with 8 to 10 mgkgday, given twice-a-day. For \npatients aged 2 to 4 years and under 20 kg, a starting dose of 16 to \n20 mgkgday may be considered. Recommended daily dose is \ndependent upon patient weight. \n Adjunctive Patients (Aged 216 Years): For patients aged 4 to 16 \nyears, target maintenance dose should be achieved over 2 weeks. For \npatients aged 2 to 4 years, maximum maintenance dose should be \nachieved over 2 to 4 weeks and should not to exceed 60 mgkgday.\n Conversion to Monotherapy for Patients (Aged 416 Years) \nMaximum increment of 10 mgkgday at weekly intervals, \nconcomitant antiepileptic drugs can be completely withdrawn over 3 \nto 6 weeks.\n Initiation of Monotherapy for Patients (Aged 416 Years) \nIncrements of 5 mgkgday every third day.\nContraindications\nOxcarbazepine is contraindicated in patients with a known \nhypersensitivity to Oxcarbazepine or to any of its components, or to \neslicarbazepine acetate.Warnings and Precautions\nCognitiveneuropsychiatric events (psychomotor slowing, difficulty \nwith concentration, language problems, somnolence or fatigue, \nataxia and gait disturbances) were some of common adverse effects \nassociated with Oxcarbazepine. Cases of asymptomatic \nhyponatremia were reported. Monitoring of serum sodium levels \nshould be considered if the patient is on other medications known to \ndecrease serum sodium levels or if symptoms of hyponatremia \n(nausea, malaise, headache, confusion) develop. Patients with a \nhypersensitivity reaction to carbamazepine should be treated with \nOxcarbazepine only.\nAdverse Effects\nClinical trials show that Oxcarbazepine is better tolerated than \ncarbamazepine. The most common adverse effects were: Central \nnervous system: dizziness; diplopia; headache, nystagmus; abnormal \ngait; GI: nausea; vomiting; abdominal pain; Dermatologic: rash; \nSerum electrolytes: hyponatremia. Bone marrow suppression and \nhepatotoxicity, associated with carbamazepine, were infrequently \nreported with Oxcarbazepine.\nDrug Interaction\nIn vitro and in vivo studies showed little or no interaction of \nOxcarbazepine with cytochrome P450 enzymes. Since Oxcarbazepine \nis used as adjunctive therapy, trials of Oxcarbazepine given \nconcomitantly with other antiepileptics explored the effects of \nOxcarbazepine on others antiepileptics. No drug interactions with \ncimetidine, dextropropoxyphene, erythromycin and warfarin. \nUse in Pregnancy & Lactation\nPregnancy Category C. \nThere are no well-controlled clinical studies in pregnant women. \nOxcarbazepine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential \nbenefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Oxcarbazepine is \nexcreted in the human milk. A milk-to-plasma concentration ratio of \n0.5 was found. So, Oxcarbazepine is not to be used during breast \nfeeding.\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 3 00C in a dry place. Protect from \nlight and moisture.\nHow Supplied\nLeptal 300 mg: Each box contains 3x10s tablet in Alu-PVDC blister \npack.\nLeptal 600 mg: Each box contains 2x10s tablet in Alu-PVDC blister \npack.\n  Medicine: Keep out of reach of childrenLeptal\nOxcarbazepine USP\nManufactured by\nHealthcare Pharmaceuticals Limited\nGazariapara, Rajendrapur\nGazipur-1703, Bangladesh 13002046\nDcvvb\njc&Uvj 300 wg.MÖv.

Cases of asymptomatic \nhyponatremia were reported. Monitoring of serum sodium levels \nshould be considered if the patient is on other medications known to \ndecrease serum sodium levels or if symptoms of hyponatremia \n(nausea, malaise, headache, confusion) develop. Patients with a \nhypersensitivity reaction to carbamazepine should be treated with \nOxcarbazepine only.\nAdverse Effects\nClinical trials show that Oxcarbazepine is better tolerated than \ncarbamazepine. The most common adverse effects were: Central \nnervous system: dizziness; diplopia; headache, nystagmus; abnormal \ngait; GI: nausea; vomiting; abdominal pain; Dermatologic: rash; \nSerum electrolytes: hyponatremia. Bone marrow suppression and \nhepatotoxicity, associated with carbamazepine, were infrequently \nreported with Oxcarbazepine.\nDrug Interaction\nIn vitro and in vivo studies showed little or no interaction of \nOxcarbazepine with cytochrome P450 enzymes. Since Oxcarbazepine \nis used as adjunctive therapy, trials of Oxcarbazepine given \nconcomitantly with other antiepileptics explored the effects of \nOxcarbazepine on others antiepileptics.

      "composition": "Composition\nEach tablet contains Bromazepam BP 3 mg.\nProperties and effects\nLexopil is a powerful psychotropic agent. In low dosage, it \nselectively reduces tension and anxiety. In high dosage, sedative and \nmuscle-relaxing properties appear.\nIndications\nEmotional disturbances:  Acute tension and anxiety states. \nDifficulties in interpersonal contact. Agitation, insomnia, anxious and agitated depressive reactions. Functional disturbances in the \ncardiovascular and respiratory systems: Pseudoangina pectoris, \nprecordial anxiety, tachycardia, emotiogenic hypertension, dyspnea and hyperventilation. In the gastrointestinal system: Irritable bowel syndrome, epigastric pain, spasm, bloating diarrhoea etc. In the genitourinary system: Frequency, irritable bladder, and dysmenorrhea. Psychosomatic disorders: Psychogenic headache, psychogenic dermatosis, asthma, gastric and duodenal ulcer, ulcerative colitis. Emotional reactions to chronic organic disease. Adjuvant to psychotherapy in psychoneurosis.\nDosage and administration\nStandard dosage: Average dosing for outpatient therapy: 1.53 mg up to three times daily. Severe cases, especially in hospital: 612 mg two or three times daily. These amounts are general \nrecommendations, and dosage should be individually determined. \nTreatment of outpatients should begin with low doses, gradually \nincreasing to the optimum level. The duration of treatment should be \nas short as possible. The patient should be reassessed regularly and \nthe need for continued treatment should be evaluated, especially in case the patient is symptom free. The overall treatment generally \nshould not be more than 812 weeks, including a tapering-off \nprocess. In certain cases extension beyond the maximum treatment \nperiod may be necessary, if so, it should not take place without re-evaluation of the patients status with special expertise. Special dosage instructions: Lexopil\n is usually not indicated in children, \nbut if the physician feels Lexopil treatment is appropriate, then the \ndose should be adjusted to their low bodyweight (about0.10.3 mgkg bodyweight). Elderly patients and those with impaired hepatic \nfunction require lower doses because of individual variations in \nsensitivity and pharmacokinetics.\nContraindications\nLexopil must not be administered to patients with known \nhypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, severe respiratory insufficiency, severe hepatic insufficiency (benzodiazepines are not indicated to \ntreat patients with severe hepatic insufficiency as they may cause \nencephalopathy) or sleep apnea syndrome.\nPrecautions\nDependence: The use of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like agents may lead to the development of physical and psychological dependence upon these products. The risk of dependence increases with dose and duration of treatment; it is also greater in predisposed \npatients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse. Withdrawal: Once \nphysical dependence has developed, termination of treatment will be accompanied by withdrawal symptoms. These may consist of headaches, muscle pain, extreme anxiety, tension, restlessness, \nconfusion and irritability. In severe cases the following symptoms \nmay occur: derealization, depersonalization, hyperacusis, numbness and tingling of the extremities, hypersensitivity to light, noise and physical contact, hallucinations or epileptic seizures. Rebound anxiety, a transient syndrome whereby the symptoms that led to \ntreatment with Lexopil\n recur in an enhanced form, may occur on \nwithdrawal of treatment. It may be accompanied by other reactions \nincluding mood changes, anxiety or sleep disturbances and \nrestlessness. Since the risk of withdrawal phenomena and rebound \nphenomena is greater after abrupt discontinuation of treatment, it is recommended that the dosage be decreased gradually. Amnesia: Benzodiazepines may induce anterograde amnesia. Anterograde amnesia may occur using higher therapeutic dosages (documented \nat 6 mg) the risk increasing at higher dosages. Duration of \ntreatment: It may be useful to inform the patient when treatment is \nstarted that it will be of limited duration and to explain precisely how \nthe dosage will be progressively decreased. It is important that the patient should be aware of the possibility of rebound phenomena that may occur while the drug is being discontinued. General \nprecautions: The patient should be checked regularly at the start of \ntreatment in order to minimize the dosage andor the frequency of \nadministration and to prevent overdose due to accumulation. When benzodiazepines are used, withdrawal symptoms may develop when changing to a benzodiazepine with a considerably shorter elimination half-life. Benzodiazepines should not be used alone to treat \ndepression or anxiety associated with depression (suicide may be \nprecipitated in such patients). Benzodiazepines are not recommended for the primary treatment of psychotic illness. Patients with known or presumed dependence on alcohol, medicines or drugs should not take benzodiazepines, except in rare situations under medical supervision. Specific patient groups: In patients \nwith myasthenia gravis who are prescribed Lexopil\n, care should be \ntaken on account of pre-existing muscle weakness. Particular care is \nrequired in patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency due to the \nrisk of respiratory depression. Effects on ability to drive or to use \nmachines: Sedation, amnesia and impaired muscular function may \nadversely affect the ability to drive or to use machinery. This effect is \nincreased if the patient has taken alcohol. \nPregnancy, nursing mothers\nThe safety of bromazepam for use in human pregnancy has not been \nestablished. A review of spontaneously reported adverse drug events \nshows no greater incidence than would be anticipated from a similar \nuntreated population. An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of minor tranquilizers (diazepam, meprobamate and chlordiazepoxide) during the first trimester of \npregnancy has been suggested in several studies. Bromazepam \nshould be avoided during pregnancy unless there is no safer \nalternative. If the product is prescribed to a woman of childbearing potential, she should be warned to contact her physician regarding \ndiscontinuance of the product if she intends to become or suspects \nthat she is pregnant. Administration of bromazepam during the last \nthree months of pregnancy or during labor is allowed only in the \nevent of a strict medical indication as, due to the pharmacological \naction of the product, effects on the neonate can be expected, such as hypothermia, hypotonia and moderate respiratory depression. Moreover, infants born to mothers who took benzodiazepines chronically during the latter stages of pregnancy may have developed physical dependence and may be at some risk for developing withdrawal symptoms in the postnatal period. As benzodiazepines pass into breast milk, nursing mothers should not take Lexopil\n.\nUndesirable effects\nLexopil is well tolerated in therapeutic doses. The following \nundesirable effects may occur: fatigue, drowsiness, muscle \nweakness, numbed emotions, reduced alertness, confusion, \nheadache, dizziness, ataxia or double vision. These phenomena \noccur predominantly at the start of therapy and usually disappear with prolonged administration. Gastrointestinal disturbances, changes in libido and skin reactions have been reported occasionally. Anterograde amnesia may occur using therapeutic \ndosages, the risk increasing at higher dosages. Amnesiac effects \nmay be associated with inappropriate behaviour. Pre-existing depression may be unmasked during benzodiazepine use. Paradoxical reactions like restlessness, agitation, irritability, aggressiveness, delusion, rages, nightmares, hallucinations, \npsychoses, inappropriate behaviour and other adverse behavioural \neffects are known to occur when using benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine-like agents. Should this occur, the use of the drug should be discontinued. They are more likely to occur in children and elderly patients than in other patients. Chronic use (even at \ntherapeutic doses) may lead to the development of physical \ndependence: discontinuation of therapy may result in withdrawal or rebound phenomena  Psychological dependence may occur. Abuse of benzodiazepines has been reported.\nInteractions\nAs with all psychoactive substances, the effect of Lexopil\n may be \nintensified by alcohol. Concomitant intake with alcohol should be avoided. If Lexopil\n is combined with other centrally active drugs, its \ncentral-sedative effect may be enhanced. These drugs may include antidepressants, hypnotics, narcotic analgesics, antipsychotics, \nanxiolyticssedatives, antiepileptic drugs, sedative antihistamines and \nanesthetics. In the case of narcotic analgesics enhancement of euphoria may also occur, leading to an increase in psychological dependence. There is a possibility that compounds which inhibit certain hepatic enzymes may influence the activity of those \nbenzodiazepines that are metabolized by these enzymes. \nCo-administration of cimetidine may prolong the elimination half-life of Bromazepam.\nPacks\nEach box contains 5x10s Tablets in blister pack.\nStorage\nStore in a cool and dry place below 30\n0 C.

      "indications": "Indications\nHypertensionLosacor\n (Loasartan) and Losacor plus (Losartan & \nHydrochlorothiazide) are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Losacor\n may be used alone or in combination with other \nantihypertensive agents.\nType 2 Diabetic Patients with Proteinuria and Hypertension\nLosacor is also indicated to delay the progression of renal disease, \nend stage renal disease, and to reduce proteinuria. \nHypertensive Patients with Left Venticular Hypertrophy\nLosacor plus is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with \nhypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.",
      "dosage": "Dosage & administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (Losartan) tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with thiazide diuretics.    \nPharmacokinetics\nLosartan is an orally active agent that undergoes substantial \nfirst-pass metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes. It is converted to an active carboxylic acid metabolite that is responsible for most of \nthe angiotensin II receptor antagonism. \nThe terminal half-life of losartan itself is about 2 hours, and that of \nactive metabolite, about 6-9 hours. Following oral administration, losartan is well absorbed, with systemic bioavailability of losartan approximately 33. Mean peak concentration of losartan occurs at about 1 hour, and that of its active metabolite at about 3-4 hours. \nBoth losartan and its active metabolite are highly bound to plasma \nprotein primarily albumin. The volume of distribution of losartan is \nabout 34 liters, and that of the active metabolite is about 12 liters.\nTotal plasma clearance of losartan is about 600 mLmin. Total plasma \nclearance of the active metabolite is about 50 mLmin. Both biliary \nand urinary excretion contribute substantially to the elimination of losartan and its metabolites.\nAfter oral administration of hydrochlorothiazide, diuresis begins \nwithin 2 hours, peaks in about 4 hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney. The plasma half-life varies between 5.6 and 14.8 hours. At \nleast 61 percent of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 \nhours. Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placenta but not the blood-brain barrier. It is excreted in breast milk.\nIndications\nHypertensionLosacor\n (Loasartan) and Losacor plus (Losartan & \nHydrochlorothiazide) are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Losacor\n may be used alone or in combination with other \nantihypertensive agents.\nType 2 Diabetic Patients with Proteinuria and Hypertension\nLosacor is also indicated to delay the progression of renal disease, \nend stage renal disease, and to reduce proteinuria. \nHypertensive Patients with Left Venticular Hypertrophy\nLosacor plus is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with \nhypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.\nDosage & Administration\nHypertensionThe usual starting dose of losartan is 50 mg once daily, with 25 mg \nrecommended for patients with intravascular volume depletion (e.g. \npatients treated with diuretic) and patients with hepatic impairment. Losartan can be administered at a total daily dose of 25 to 100 mg. \nHydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12.5 to 50 mg once daily \nand can be given at doses of 12.5 mg as Losacor\n plus. To minimize \nthe dose dependent side effects, it is usually appropriate to begin the combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the \ndesired effect with monotherapy.\nHypertensive Patients with Left Venticular Hypertrophy\nTreatment should be initiated with losartan 50 mg once daily. \nHydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg should be added if blood pressure reduction is inadequate. For further blood pressure reduction other antihypertensives should be added. \nContraindication\nLosacor\n and Losacor plus are contraindicated in patients who are \nhypersensitive to any component of this product. Because of the Hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs.Adverse reactionsIn general, treatment with losartan and losartan potassium-hydrochlorothiazide is well tolerated. For the most part, adverse experiences have generally been mild and transient in nature and have not required discontinuation of therapy. The overall \nincidence of adverse experiences with losartan and \nhydrochlorothiazide was comparable to placebo. Some adverse \nreactions such as dizziness, fatigue, coughing, diarrhea etc may be observed.  \nSpecial Population\nPediatricThe pharmacokinetics of losartan has not been investigated in \npatients  18 years of age.\nGeriatric and Gender\nThe pharmacokinetics of losartan has been investigated in the \nelderly (65-75 years) and in both genders. Plasma concentrations of \nlosartan and its active metabolite are similar in elderly and young hypertensives. Plasma concentrations of losartan were about twice \nas high in female hypertensives as male hypertensives, but \nconcentration of the active metabolites was similar in both males and \nfemales. \nPrecautions\nRenal InsufficiencyAs a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function have been reported in susceptible individuals treated with losartan. These changes in renal function \nwere reversible upon discontinuation of therapy.\nIn patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the \nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors has been associated with oliguria andor progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure. Similar \noutcome have been reported with losartan.\nThiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In \npatients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired \nrenal function. \nHepatic Insufficiency\nBased on pharmacokinetic data it was found that there is \nsignificantly increased plasma concentrations of losartan and its \nactive metabolite in cirrhotic patients. A lower dose should be considered for patients with hepatic impairment, or a history of hepatic impairment. \nPregnancy & Lactation\nDue to the mechanism of action of angiotensin II antagonists, a risk for the fetus cannot be excluded. As for any drug that also acts directly on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, losartan \nshould not be used during pregnancy. If pregnancy is detected \nduring therapy, it should be discontinued as soon as possible. \nIt is not known whether losartan is excreted in human milk. Losartan \nand its active metabolites were shown to be present in rat milk. \nThiazides appear in human milk. Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant, a decision should be made whether to discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\nDrug Interactions\nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed \nwhen losartan was coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, \nwarfarin, cimetidine and phenobarbital. Rifampin, an inducer of drug metabolism, decreased the concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite. Ketoconazole did not affect the conversion of losartan to the active metabolite. \nPacks\nLosacor\n-50: 5x6s tablet in alu-alu blister\nLosacor plus: 5x6s tablet in alu-alu blister\nStorageStore in a cool and dry place below 30C.

      "composition": "Composition\nMaxnor 4 mg4 ml: Each 4 ml sterile solution contains Norepinephrine Bitartrate (Monohydrate) USP 7 .974 mg equivalent to Norepinephrine 4 mg.\nClinical pharmacology\nMaxnor functions as a peripheral vasoconstrictor (alpha-adrenergic action) and as an inotropic stimulator of the heart and dilator of coronary \narteries (beta-adrenergic action).\nIndications and usage\nFor blood pressure control in certain acute hypotensive states (e.g., pheochromocytomectomy, sympathectomy, poliomyelitis, spinal anesthesia, myocardial infarction, septicemia, blood transfusion, and drug reactions). As an adjunct in the treatment of cardiac arrest and profound \nhypotension.\nDosage and administration\nAn infusion of Maxnor\n should be given into a large vein. Restoration of Blood Pressure in Acute Hypotensive States. Blood volume depletion \nshould always be corrected as fully as possible before any vasopressor is administered. When, as an emergency measure, intraaortic pressures \nmust be maintained to prevent cerebral or coronary artery ischemia, Maxnor can be administered before and concurrently with blood volume \nreplacement. Diluent: Maxnor should be diluted in 5 percent dextrose injection or 5 percent dextrose and sodium chloride injections. These \ndextrose containing fluids are protection against significant loss of potency due to oxidation. Administration in saline solution alone is not \nrecommended. Whole blood or plasma, if indicated to increase blood volume, should be administered separately (for example, by use of a \nY-tube and individual containers if given simultaneously). Average Dosage: Add the content of the ampoule (4 mg4 ml) of Maxnor to 1,000 \nmL of a 5 percent dextrose containing solution. Each ml of this dilution contains 4 mcg of the base of Maxnor. Give this solution by \nintravenous infusion. Insert a plastic intravenous catheter through a suitable bore needle well advanced centrally into the vein and securely fixed with adhesive tape, avoiding, if possible, a catheter tie-in technique as this promotes stasis. An IV drip chamber or other suitable \nmetering device is essential to permit an accurate estimation of the rate of flow in drops per minute. After observing the response to an initial \ndose of 2 ml to 3 ml (from 8 mcg to 12 mcg of base) per minute, adjust the rate of flow to establish and maintain a low normal blood pressure \n(usually 80 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg systolic) sufficient to maintain the circulation to vital organs. In previously hypertensive patients, it is \nrecommended that the blood pressure should be raised no higher than 40 mm Hg below the preexisting systolic pressure. The average maintenance dose ranges from 0.5 ml to 1 ml per minute (from 2 mcg to 4 mcg of base). High Dosage: In all cases, dosage of Maxnor\n should \nbe titrated according to the response of the patient. Occasionally much larger or even enormous daily doses (as high as 68 mg base or 17 ampoules) may be necessary if the patient remains hypotensive, but occult blood volume depletion should always be suspected and corrected when present. Central venous pressure monitoring is usually helpful in detecting and treating this situation. Fluid Intake: The degree of dilution \ndepends on clinical fluid volume requirements. If large volumes of fluid (dextrose) are needed at a flow rate that would involve an excessive dose of the pressor agent per unit of time, a solution more dilute than 4 mcg per ml should be used. On the other hand, when large volumes of \nfluid are clinically undesirable, a concentration greater than 4 mcg per ml may be necessary. Duration of Therapy: The infusion should be \ncontinued until adequate blood pressure and tissue perfusion are maintained without therapy. Infusions of Maxnor\n should be reduced \ngradually, avoiding abrupt withdrawal. In some of the reported cases of vascular collapse due to acute myocardial infarction, treatment was required for up to six days.\nAdjunctive Treatment in Cardiac Arrest: Infusions of Maxnor\n are usually administered intravenously during cardiac resuscitation to restore and \nmaintain an adequate blood pressure after an effective heartbeat and ventilation have been established by other means. Maxnor powerful \nbeta-adrenergic stimulating action is also thought to increase the strength and effectiveness of systolic contractions once they occur. Average \nDosage: To maintain systemic blood pressure during the management of cardiac arrest, Maxnor is used in the same manner as described \nunder Restoration of Blood Pressure in Acute Hypotensive States.Do not use the solution if its color is pinkish or darker than slightly yellow or if it contains a precipitate.Avoid contact with iron salts, alkalis, or oxidizing agents.\nContraindications\nMaxnor\n should not be given to patients who are hypotensive from blood volume deficits except as an emergency measure to maintain \ncoronary and cerebral artery perfusion until blood volume replacement therapy can be completed. If Maxnor is continuously administered to \nmaintain blood pressure in the absence of blood volume replacement, the following may occur: severe peripheral and visceral vasoconstriction, decreased renal perfusion and urine output, poor systemic blood flow despite normal blood pressure, tissue hypoxia, and lactate acidosis.\nMaxnor\n should also not be given to patients with mesenteric or peripheral vascular thrombosis (because of the risk of increasing ischemia \nand extending the area of infarction) unless, in the opinion of the attending physician, the administration of Maxnor is necessary as a \nlife-saving procedure. Cyclopropane and halothane anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability and therefore seem to sensitize the myocardium to the action of intravenously administered epinephrine or norepinephrine. Hence, the use of Maxnor\n during cyclopropane and \nhalothane anesthesia is generally considered contraindicated because of the risk of producing ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. The same type of cardiac arrhythmias may result from the use of Maxnor\n in patients with profound hypoxia or hypercarbia.\nWarnings\nMaxnor should be used with extreme caution in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or antidepressants of the triptyline \nor imipramine types, because severe, prolonged hypertension may result.\nPrecautions\nGeneral\nAvoid Hypertension: Because of the potency of Maxnor and because of varying response to pressor substances, the possibility always exists \nthat dangerously high blood pressure may be produced with overdoses of this pressor agent. It is desirable, therefore, to record the blood \npressure every two minutes from the time administration is started until the desired blood pressure is obtained, then every five minutes if \nadministration is to be continued. The rate of flow must be watched constantly, and the patient should never be left unattended while receiving \nMaxnor. Headache may be a symptom of hypertension due to overdosage. Site of Infusion: Whenever possible, infusions of Maxnor should \nbe given into a large vein, particularly an antecubital vein because, when administered into this vein, the risk of necrosis of the overlying skin from prolonged vasoconstriction is apparently very slight. Some authors have indicated that the femoral vein is also an acceptable route of administration. A catheter tie-in technique should be avoided, if possible, since the obstruction to blood flow around the tubing may cause \nstasis and increased local concentration of the drug. Occlusive vascular diseases (for example, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, diabetic \nendarteritis, Buergers disease) are more likely to occur in the lower than in the upper extremity. Therefore, one should avoid the veins of the \nleg in elderly patients or in those suffering from such disorders. Gangrene has been reported in a lower extremity when infusions of Maxnor\n \nwere given in an ankle vein.\nExtravasation: The infusion site should be checked frequently for free flow. Care should be taken to avoid extravasation of Maxnor into the \ntissues, as local necrosis might ensue due to the vasoconstrictive action of the drug. Blanching along the course of the infused vein, sometimes without obvious extravasation, has been attributed to vasa vasorum constriction with increased permeability of the vein wall, permitting some leakage.\nThis also may progress on rare occasions to superficial slough, particularly during infusion into leg veins in elderly patients or in those \nsuffering from obliterative vascular disease. Hence, if blanching occurs, consideration should be given to the advisability of changing the infusion site at intervals to allow the effects of local vasoconstriction to subside.\nIMPORTANT  Antidote for Extravasation Ischemia: To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, the area \nshould be infiltrated as soon as possible with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of phentolamine, an adrenergic \nblocking agent. A syringe with a fine hypodermic needle should be used, with the solution being infiltrated liberally throughout the area, which \nis easily identified by its cold, hard, and pallid appearance. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours. Therefore, phentolamine should be given as soon as possible after the \nextravasation is noted.\nSide Effects\nBody As A Whole: Ischemic injury due to potent vasoconstrictor action and tissue hypoxia. Cardiovascular System: Bradycardia, probably as a \nreflex result of a rise in blood pressure, arrhythmias. Nervous System: Anxiety, transient headache. Respiratory System: Respiratory difficulty. Skin and Appendages: Extravasation necrosis at injection site. Prolonged administration of any potent vasopressor may result in plasma volume \ndepletion which should be continuously corrected by appropriate fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy. If plasma volumes are not \ncorrected, hypotension may recur when Maxnor\n is discontinued, or blood pressure may be maintained at the risk of severe peripheral and \nvisceral vasoconstriction (e.g., decreased renal perfusion) with diminution in blood flow and tissue perfusion with subsequent tissue hypoxia \nand lactic acidosis and possible ischemic injury. Gangrene of extremities has been rarely reported. Overdoses or conventional doses in \nhypersensitive persons (e.g., hyperthyroid patients) cause severe hypertension with violent headache, photophobia, stabbing retrosternal pain, pallor, intense sweating, and vomiting.\nUse in Pregnancy & Lactation\nPregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Maxnor\n. It is also not known whether Maxnor can cause \nfetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Maxnor should be given to a pregnant woman only if \nclearly needed.Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should \nbe exercised when Maxnor\n is administered to a nursing woman.\nUse in Children & Adolescents\nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients has not been established.\nGeriatric Use\nClinical studies of Maxnor did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently \nfrom younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the \ngreater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.\nMaxnor\n infusions should not be administered into the veins in the leg in elderly patients.\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Studies have not been performed.\nDrug Interactions\nCyclopropane and halothane anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability and therefore seem to sensitize the myocardium to the action of intravenously administered epinephrine or norepinephrine. Hence, the use of Maxnor\n during cyclopropane and halothane anesthesia is \ngenerally considered contraindicated because of the risk of producing ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. The same type of cardiac \narrhythmias may result from the use of Maxnor in patients with profound hypoxia or hypercarbia.\nMaxnor should be used with extreme caution in patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or antidepressants of the triptyline \nor imipramine types, because severe, prolonged hypertension may result.\nOverdosage\nOverdosage with Maxnor may result in headache, severe hypertension, reflex bradycardia, marked increase in peripheral resistance, and \ndecreased cardiac output. In case of accidental overdosage, as evidenced by excessive blood pressure elevation, discontinue Maxnor until \nthe condition of the patient stabilizes.\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30 0 C in a dry place.

Mirtazapine is an \nantagonist of central alpha2-auto and hetero-adrenoceptors which causes an increase in both noradrenaline and serotonin release. The effect of released serotonin is exerted specificially via 5-HT\n1 type \nreceptors, because 5-HT 2 and 5HT 3 type receptors are specially \nblocked by mirtazapine. Mirtazapine is a moderate antagonist at muscarinic receptors, a property that may explain the relatively low incidence of anticholinergic side effects associated with its use.\nPharmacokinetic Properties\nAfter oral",

      "indications": "Indications \nNapryn is indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, \nosteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and juvenile rheumatoid \narthritis. Napryn is also indicated for the treatment of tendonitis, \nbursitis, acute gout,  for the management of pain, primary \ndysmenorrhea, migraine treatment and prophylaxis.",
      "dosage": "Dosage and administration\nNaproxen Tablet\nOnset of pain relief can begin within 1 hour in patients taking \nnaproxen. A lower dose should be considered in patients with renal \nor hepatic impairment or in elderly patients. Napryn is not \nrecommended in patients with baseline creatinine clearance less \nthan 10 mlminute because accumulation of naproxen metabolites \nhas been seen in such patients. Napryn may be given orally either \nin fasting state or with meals andor antacids. \nDose in adults\nChronic conditions: Osteoarthritis  Rheumatoid arthritis  Ankylosing \nspondylitis  chronic pain states in which there is an inflammatory \ncomponent: The recommended dose of naproxen is 250 mg or 500 \nmg taken twice daily (morning and evening), or a single daily dose of \n500-1000 mg given in the morning or evening, or 500 mg taken twice \ndaily, or a single daily dose of 1000 mg given in the evening. During \nlong-term administration the dose of naproxen may be adjusted up \nor down depending on the clinical response of the patient. A lower \ndaily dose may suffice for long-term administration. In patients who \ntolerate lower doses well, the dose may be increased to 1500 mg per \nday when a higher level of anti-inflammatoryanalgesic activity is \nrequired. When treating patients with naproxen 1500 mgday, the \nphysician should observe sufficient increased clinical benefit to offset \nthe potential increased risk. The morning and evening doses do not \nhave to be equal in size and administration of the drug more \nfrequently than twice daily does not generally make a difference in \nresponse.\nAcute conditions: AnalgesiaDysmenorrheaAcute musculoskeletal \nconditionsAcute pain states in which there is an inflammatory \ncomponent. The recommended starting dose is Napryn 500 mg \nfollowed by Napryn 250 mg every 6-8 hours as required. \nAcute gout: The recommended starting dose is of 750 mg Naproxen, \nfollowed by 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack has subsided. \nMigraine: For treatment of acute migraine headache, the dose is \nNaproxen 750 mg at the first symptom of an impending attack. An \nadditional dose of Napryn 250 mg to 500 mg can be taken \nthroughout the day, if necessary, but not before half an hour after the \ninitial dose. For prophylaxis of migraine headache, the dose of \nNapryn is 500 mg twice daily. If no improvement is seen within 4-6 \nweeks, the drug should be discontinued.\nNaproxen Suspension\nChildren:\nFor Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis:\nThe usual dose for children over 2 years is 10mgkgday given as two \ndivided doses at 12-hours intervals.

      "side_effects": "Not Found",
      "contraindications": "Contraindications\nNaproxen is contraindicated in patients who have had allergic \nreactions to naproxen. It is also contraindicated in patients in whom \naspirin or other nonsteroidal anti inflammatoryanalgesic drugs \ninduce the syndrome of asthma, rhinitis and nasal polyps. Naproxen \nis contraindicated in patients with active peptic ulceration or active \ngastrointestinal bleeding. Naproxen is contraindicated in children \nunder 2 years of age since safety in this age group has not been \nestablished.\nAdverse Reactions\nGastrointestinal: abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, \nheartburn, nausea, stomatitis. Central nervous system: dizziness, \ndrowsiness, headache, lightheadedness, vertigo. Dermatologic: \necchymoses, itching (pruritus), purpura, skin eruptions, sweating. \nSpecial senses: hearing disturbances, tinnitus, visual disturbances. \nCardiovascular: dyspnea, edema, palpitations. General: thirst. Precautions\nGastrointestinal ulceration, bleeding and perforation: Gastrointestinal \nmucosal injury may occur. Serious gastrointestinal toxicity, such as \ngastrointestinal irritation, bleeding, ulceration and perforation can \noccur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients \ntreated with NSAIDs including naproxen therapy. In patients with a \nhistory of gastrointestinal disease, Napryn should be given under \nclose supervision. Open studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis \nwho had upper gastrointestinal dysfunction andor were intolerant of \nother commonly used NSAIDs indicated that naproxen is generally \nwell tolerated. Renal effects: There have been reports of impaired \nrenal function, renal failure, acute interstitial nephritis, hematuria, \nproteinuria, renal papillary necrosis and occasionally nephrotic \nsyndrome associated with naproxen. As with other NSAIDs, \nnaproxen should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal \nfunction or a history of kidney disease because naproxen is an \ninhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. Hematological: Naproxen \ndecreases platelet aggregation and prolongs bleeding time. This \neffect should be kept in mind when bleeding times are determined. \nPatients who have coagulation disorders or are receiving drug \ntherapy that interferes with hemostasis should be carefully observed \nif naproxen is administered. Patients at high risk of bleeding and \nthose on full anticoagulation therapy (e.g. dicoumarol derivatives) \nmay be at increased risk of bleeding if given naproxen concurrently. \nHepatic effects: Hepatic abnormalities may be the result of \nhypersensitivity rather than direct toxicity. Severe hepatic reactions, \nincluding jaundice and hepatitis (some cases of hepatitis have been \nfatal) have been reported with this drug as with other non-steroidal \nanti-inflammatory drugs. Antipyretic effects: The antipyretic and anti-\ninflammatory activities of naproxen may reduce fever and \ninflammation, thus diminishing their utility as diagnostic signs. \nPrecautions related to elderly patients: Elderly patients may be at a \ngreater risk of experiencing undesirable effects than younger \npatients. In elderly patients the clearance is reduced. Use of the \nlower end of the dosage range is recommended (see Dosage and \nadministration). Combination with other NSAIDs: The combination of \nother NSAIDs is not recommended, because of the cumulative risks \nof inducing serious NSAID-related adverse events.\nUse in Pregnancy & Lactation\nPregnancy: As with other drugs of this type, naproxen produces delay \nin parturition in animals and also affects the human fetal \ncardiovascular system (closure of ductus arteriosus). Therefore, \nnaproxen should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly \nneeded. Labour and delivery: Naproxen is not recommended in labour \nand delivery because, through its prostaglandin synthesis inhibitory \neffect, naproxen may adversely affect fetal circulation and inhibit \nuterine contractions, thus increasing the risk of uterine hemorrhage. \nNursing mothers: The naproxen anion has been found in the milk of \nlactating women at a concentration of approximately 1 of that \nfound in plasma. Because of the possible adverse effects of \nprostaglandin-inhibiting drugs on neonates, use in nursing mothers \nis not recommended.\nDrug Interactions\nConcomitant administration of antacid or cholestyramine can delay \nthe absorption of naproxen, but does not affect its extent. \nConcomitant administration of food can delay the absorption of \nnaproxen, but does not affect its extent. Naproxen is highly bound to \nplasma albumin; Patients simultaneously receiving the drug and a \nhydantoin, sulphonamide or sulphonylurea should be observed for \nadjustment of dose if required. Caution is advised when methotrexate \nis administered concurrently, since naproxen and other prostaglandin \nsynthesis-inhibiting drugs have been reported to reduce the \nclearance of methotrexate, and thus possibly enhance its toxicity. \nNaproxen can reduce the anti-hypertensive effect of beta-blockers. \nAs with other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, naproxen may \ninhibit the natriuretic effect of frusemide. Inhibition of renal lithium \nclearance leading to increases in plasma lithium concentrations has \nbeen reported. Naproxen decreases platelet aggregation and \nprolongs bleeding time. This effect should be kept in mind when \nbleeding times are determined.\nCommercial Pack\nNapryn 250 mg Tablets: Each box contains 5x10 tablets in blister pack.\nNapryn 500 mg Tablets: Each box contains 5x10 tablets in blister pack.\nNapryn 50 ml suspension: Each bottle contains 50 ml suspension.\nNapryn 10 Gel: Each lami tube contains 15 gm naproxen gel.\nStorage Condition\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30 0C in a dry place.

Cyclophosphamide \nTablets, USP are for oral use and contain 25 mg or 50 mg \nCyclophosphamide (Anhydrous). Cyclophosphamide is a synthetic \nantineoplastic drug chemically related to the nitrogen mustards. Cyclophosphamide is a white crystalline powder with the molecu-\nlar formula C7H15Cl2N2O2PH2O and a molecular weight of 279.1. \nThe chemical name for cyclophosphamide is 2-bis(2-chloroeth-\nyl)aminotetrahydro-2H-1,3,2-oxazaphosphorine 2-oxide monohy-\ndrate. Cyclophosphamide is soluble in water, saline, or ethanol and has the following structural formula: \nClinical pharmacology \nCyclophosphamide is biotransformed principally in the liver to \nactive alkylating metabolites by a mixed function microsomal \noxidase system. These metabolites interfere with the growth of \nsusceptible rapidly proliferating malignant cells. The mechanism of action is thought to involve cross-linking of tumor cell DNA. \nCyclophosphamide is well absorbed after oral administration with \na bioavailability greater than 75. The unchanged drug has an \nelimination half-life of 3 to 12 hours. It is eliminated primarily in the \nform of metabolites, but from 5 to 25 of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug. Several cytotoxic and noncytotoxic \nmetabolites have been identified in urine and in plasma. Concen-\ntrations of metabolites reach a maximum in plasma 2 to 3 hours \nafter an intravenous dose. Plasma protein binding of unchanged \ndrug is low but some metabolites are bound to an extent greater than 60. It has not been demonstrated that any single metabolite \nis responsible for either the therapeutic or toxic effects of \ncyclophosphamide. Although elevated levels of metabolites of 1 \nReference ID: 3110030 cyclophosphamide have been observed in \npatients with renal failure, increased clinical toxicity in such patients has not been demonstrated.",

      "indications": "Indications and usage \nCyclophosphamide, although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially \nwith other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are \noften susceptible to cyclophosphamide treatment: 1. Malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor \nstaging system), Hodgkins disease, lymphocytic lymphoma \n(nodular or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lympho-\nma, Burkitts lymphoma. \n2. Multiple myeloma. \n3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic \nleukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), acute \nmyelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic \n(stem-cell) leukemia in children (cyclophosphamide given during \nremission is effective in prolonging its duration). \n4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease). \n5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease). \n6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary. \n7. Retinoblastoma. \n8. Carcinoma of the breast. \nNonmalignant Disease Biopsy Proven Minimal Change \nNephrotic Syndrome in Children: Cyclophosphamide is useful \nin carefully selected cases of biopsy proven minimal change \nnephrotic syndrome in children but should not be used as primary \ntherapy.

Fever without documented \ninfection has been reported in neutropenic patients. Thrombocyto-penia or anemia develops occasionally in patients treated with \ncyclophosphamide. These hematologic effects usually can be \nreversed by reducing the drug dose or by interrupting treatment. \nRecovery from leukopenia usually begins in 7 to 10 days after \ncessation of therapy.\nUrinary System\nHemorrhagic ureteritis and renal tubular necrosis have been \nreported to occur in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Such \nlesions usually resolve following cessation of therapy.\nRespiratory System\nInterstitial pneumonitis has been reported as part of the postmar-keting experience. Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis has been \nreported in patients receiving high doses of cyclophosphamide \nover a prolonged period. Other Anaphylactic reactions have been \nreported; death has also been reported in association with this \nevent. Possible cross-sensitivity with other alkylating agents has been reported. SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion) \nhas been reported with the use of cyclophosphamide. Malaise and \nasthenia have been reported as part of the postmarketing \nexperience.\nOverdosage \nNo specific antidote for cyclophosphamide is known. Overdosage \nshould be managed with supportive measures, including appropri-\nate treatment for any concurrent infection, myelosuppression, or \ncardiac toxicity should it occur. \nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 25 C in a dry place.

Cyclophosphamide is soluble in water, saline, or ethanol and has the following structural formula: \nClinical pharmacology \nCyclophosphamide is biotransformed principally in the liver to \nactive alkylating metabolites by a mixed function microsomal \noxidase system. These metabolites interfere with the growth of \nsusceptible rapidly proliferating malignant cells. The mechanism of action is thought to involve cross-linking of tumor cell DNA. \nCyclophosphamide is well absorbed after oral",

      "warnings": "Warnings and Precautions\nPatients who have a history of hypersensitivity to carbapenems, penicillins or other beta-lactam antibiotics may also be hypersensitive to \nNeopenem. As with all beta-lactam antibiotics rare hypersensitivity reactions have been reported.\nRarely, pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with Neopenem as with virtually all antibiotics; therefore, its diagnosis should be \nconsidered in patients who develop diarrhoea in association with the use of Neopenem.\nNeopenem may reduce serum valproic acid levels. Subtherapeutic levels may be reached in some patients.\nUse in Children\nEfficacy and tolerability in infants under 3 months old have not been established; therefore, Neopenem is not recommended for use below \nthis age.\nUse in Patients with Liver Disease\nPatients with pre-existing liver disorders should have liver function monitored during treatment with Neopenem.\nUse in Pregnancy & Lactation\nPregnancy category B. The safety of Neopenem in human pregnancy has not been established, although animal studies have not shown an \nadverse effect on the developing foetus. Neopenem should not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to \nthe foetus.\nMeropenem is detectable at very low concentrations in animal breast milk. Neopenem should not be used in breast-feeding women unless \nthe potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the baby.\nAdverse Effects\nNeopenem is generally well tolerated. Adverse events rarely lead to cessation of treatment. Serious adverse events are rare \nthrombocythaemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increases in serum transaminases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, \ninflammation, thrombophlebitis, pain, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, headache, paresthesiae, rash, urticaria, pruritis, leucopenia, neutropenia, \nagranulocytosis, convulsions, oral and vaginal candidiasis, haemolytic anaemia, angioedema, manifestations of anaphylaxis, \npseudomembranous colitis, erythema multiforme, stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.\nInteractions\nProbenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion and thus inhibits the renal excretion of meropenem with the effect of \nincreasing the elimination half-life and plasma concentration of meropenem. As the potency and duration of action of Neopenem dosed \nwithout probenecid are adequate the co-administration of probenecid with Neopenem is not recommended. The potential effect of \nNeopenem on the protein binding of other medicines or metabolism has not been studied. However, the protein binding is so low \n(approximately 2) that no interactions with other compounds would be expected on the basis of this mechanism.\nNeopenem has been administered concomitantly with many other medications without apparent adverse interaction. Neopenem may \nreduce serum valproic acid levels. Subtherapeutic levels may be reached in some patients. However, no specific drug interaction studies other \nthan with probenecid were conducted.\nOverdosage\nIntentional overdosing of Neopenem is unlikely, although overdosing could occur during therapy particularly in patients with renal \nimpairment. Limited post-marketing experience indicates that if adverse events occur following overdosage, they are consistent with the adverse \nevent profile described in Adverse effects, are generally mild in severity and resolve on withdrawal or dose reduction. Symptomatic treatments \nshould be considered. In normal individuals rapid renal elimination will occur. Haemodialysis will remove Neopenem and its metabolite.\nSpecial precautions for storage\nPrior to constitution, store Neopenem powder for intravenous injection or infusion packs below 25 C. To reduce microbiological hazard, \nsolutions of Neopenem IV should be used as soon as practicable after reconstitution. The freshly reconstituted solution is recommended. Its \nefficacy is maintained for at least 2 hours at room temperature or 12 hours in the refrigerator at 2-8 C. Solutions of Neopenem should not be \nfrozen.\nSupply\nNeopenem 500 mg I.V Injection: Each combipack contains 1 vial of Meropenem Trihydrate USP 570.45 mg equivalent to anhydrous \nMeropenem 500 mg and 1 ampoule of 10 ml WFI.\nNeopenem 1 g I.V Injection: Each combipack contains 1 vial of Meropenem Trihydrate USP 1.14 g equivalent to anhydrous Meropenem 1 g \nand 1 ampoule of 20 ml WFI.\n   Medicine: Keep out of reach of children.Neopenem\nMeropenem USP\nHP 5216 71Manufactured for\nHealthc are Pharmaceutic als Ltd.\nby Popular Pharmaceutic als Ltd.

It is structurally similar to \nimipenem. Meropenem exerts its bactericidal action by interfering with vital bacterial cell wall synthesis. The ease with which it penetrates \nbacterial cells, its high level of stability to all serine b-lactamases and its marked affinity for the Penicillin Binding Proteins (PBPs) explain the \npotent bactericidal activity of Meropenem against a broad spectrum of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Meropenem is stable in susceptibility \ntests and these tests can be performed using the normal routine systems. In vitro tests show that Meropenem can act synergistically with \nvarious antibiotics. It has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo that Meropenem has a post-antibiotic effect against Gram-positive and \nGram-negative organisms.\nThe in vitro antibacterial spectrum of Meropenem includes the majority of clinically significant Gram-positive and Gram-negative, aerobic and \nanaerobic strains of bacteria.",

      "description": "Description\nFilgrastim is a Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating \nFactor (G-CSF), produced by recombinant DNA \ntechnology. G-CSF is a glycoprotein which regulates the production and release of functional neutrophils from the bone marrow. Filgrastim causes marked increase in peripheral blood neutrophil counts within 24 hours, with minor increases in monocytes. In some severe chronic neutropenia patients, Filgrastim can also induce a minor increase in the number of circulating eosinophils and basophils relative to baseline; some of these patients may present with eosinophilia or basophilia already prior to the treatment.\nIndication\nFilgrastim is indicated for -\nG The reduction in the duration of neutropenia and \nthe incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients \ntreated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy. \nG The reduction of neutropenia and its clinical \nsequelae in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation.\nG Mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells \n(PBPC) in normal donors.\nG In patients, children or adults, with severe \ncongenital, cyclic or idiopathic neutropenia with an Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC)  0.5 x 10\n9L.\nG The treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC 1 \nx 109L) in patients with advanced HIV infection.\nDosage and AdministrationFilgrastim is given by subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. Filgrastim therapy should \nonly be given in collaboration with an oncology \ncenter which has experience in G-CSF treatment and hematology and has the necessary diagnostic \nfacilities.\nEstablished cytotoxic chemotherapy:\nThe recommended dose of Filgrastim is 0.5 MU (5 micrograms)kgday. The first dose of Filgrastim \nshould not be administered less than 24 hours \nfollowing cytotoxic chemotherapy. Filgrastim may be given as a daily subcutaneous injection or as a daily intravenous infusion diluted in 5 glucose solution given over 30 minutes. \nDaily dosing with Filgrastim should continue until the expected neutrophil nadir is passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range. Following established chemotherapy with \nsolid tumors, lymphomas, and lymphoid leukemia, \nit is expected that the duration of treatment \nrequired to fulfill this criteria will be up to 14 days. Following induction and consolidation treatment \nfor acute myeloid leukemia, the duration of \ntreatment may be substantially longer (up to 38 \ndays) depending on the type, dose and schedule \nof cytotoxic chemotherapy used. \nIn patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, a transient increase in neutrophil counts is typically seen 1 to 2 days after initiation of Filgrastim therapy. However, for a sustained therapeutic response, Filgrastim therapy should not be discontinued before expected nadir has passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range. Premature discontinuation of Filgrastim therapy, prior to the time of the expected neutrophil nadir, is not recommended.\nSevere chronic neutropenia (SCN):\nCongenital neutropenia: The recommended \nstarting dose is 1.2 MU (12 micrograms)kgday subcutaneously as a single dose or in divided doses. \nIdiopathic or cyclic neutropenia: The \nrecommended starting dose is 0.5 MU (5 micrograms)kgday subcutaneously as a single dose or in divided doses.\nDose adjustment:  Filgrastim should be \nadministered daily by subcutaneous injection until \nthe neutrophil count has reached and can be maintained at more than 1.5 x 10\n9L. When the \nresponse has been obtained the minimal effective dose to maintain this level should be established. Long term daily administration is required to maintain an adequate neutrophil count. After one to two weeks of therapy, the initial dose may be doubled or halved depending upon the patients response. Subsequently the dose may be individually adjusted every 1 to 2 weeks to maintain the average neutrophil count between \n1.5 x10\n9L and 10 x109L . A faster schedule of \ndose escalation may be considered in patients presenting with severe infections. \nIn clinical trials, 97 of patients who responded had a complete response at doses  24 \nmicrogramskgday in patients with severe \nchronic neutropenia has not been established. \nThe safety and efficacy of Filgrastim are similar in \nadults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy.\nSpecial Dosage Instructions\nClinical trials with Filgrastim have included a small number of elderly patients but special studies have not been performed in this group and therefore specific dosage recommendations cannot be made.Studies of Filgrastim in patients with severe \nimpairment of renal or hepatic function \ndemonstrate that it exhibits a similar \npharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile to that seen in normal individuals. Dose adjustment is not required in these circumstances.\nAdverse Reactions\nNausea, vomiting, musculoskeletal pain, bone pain, myalgia, headache, exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis, splenic rupture, sickle cell crisis, acute respiratory distress syndrome \n(ARDS), increased alkaline phosphatase.\nContra",

Each actuation delivers \nNitroglycerin USP 400 mcg .\nClinical Pharmacology \nThe principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin \nis relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, producing a \nvasodilator effect on both peripheral arteries and \nveins with more prominent effects on the latter. \nDilation of the post-capillary vessels, including large \nveins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood and \ndecreases venous return to the heart, thereby \nreducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure \n(pre-load). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic \nvascular resistance and arterial pressure (after-load).\nIndications and Usage \nNitrin Sublingual Spray is indicated for acute relief of \nan attack or prophylaxis of angina pectoris due to \ncoronary artery disease.\nDosage and Administration\nAt the onset of an attack, one or two metered sprays \nshould be administered under the tongue. No more \nthan three metered sprays are recommended within a \n15-minute period. If the chest pain persists, prompt \nmedical attention is recommended. Nitrin Sublingual \nSpray may be used prophylactically five to ten minutes \nprior to engaging in activities which might precipitate \nan acute attack.\nContraindications \nNitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients who are \nallergic to it. Nitrin Sublingual Spray is \ncontraindicated in patients taking certain drugs for \nerectile dysfunction (phosphodiesterase inhibitors), \nHypotensive Shock, Narrow-angle Glucoma, Severe \nanaemia, Cerebral haemorrhage and brain trauma.\nSide Effects\nTransitional, mild burning sensation in the mouth. \nPulsation in the head, facial flush, headache, \ndizziness, palpitation, sensation of heat, nausea, \nsweating.

Desmopressin Acetate Tablets are contraindicated in patients with hypona-tremia or a history of hyponatremia. \nWARNINGS\nVery rare cases of hyponatremia have been reported from world-wide postmarketing experience in patients treated with Desmopressin Acetate Tablets. Desmopressin Acetate Tablets are a potent antidiuretic which, when administered, may lead to water intoxication and hyponatremia. Unless properly diagnosed and treated hyponatremia can be fatal. Therefore, fluid restriction is recommended and should be discussed with the patient andor guardian. Careful medical supervision is required. \nPRECAUTIONS \nIntranasal formulations of desmopressin acetate at high doses and Desmopressin Acetate Injection have infrequently produced a slight elevation of blood pressure which disappears with a reduction of dosage. Although this effect has not been observed when single oral doses up to 0.6 mg have been administered, the drug should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery insufficiency andor hyperten-sive cardiovascular disease, because of a possible rise in blood pressure. Drug Interactions: Although the pressor activity of desmo-pressin acetate are very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inqibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution. \nNursing Mothers: There have been no controlled studies in \nnursing mothers. Caution should be exercised when desmopressin acetate is administered to nursing mothers.\nADVERSE REACTIONS Infrequently, large doses of the \nintranasal formulations of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets and \nDesmopressin Acetate Injection have produced transient \nheadache, nausea, flushing and mild abdominal cramps. These \nsymptoms have disappeared with reduction in dosage. \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \nAdults and Children: It is recommended that patients be started \non doses of 0.05 mg (12 of the 0.1 mg tablet) two times a day and individually adjusted to their optimum therapeutic dose. \nMost patients in clinical trials found that the optimal dosage \nrange is 0.1 mg to 0.8 mg daily, administered in divided doses. \nEach dose should be separately adjusted for an adequate \ndiurnal rhythm of water turnover. Total daily dosage should be \nincreased or decreased in the range of 0.1 mg to 1.2 mg divided \ninto two or three daily doses as needed to obtain adequate \nantidiuresis. Geriatric Use: This drug is known to be \nsubstantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic \nreactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired \nrenal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have \ndecreased renal function, care should be taken in dose \nselection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.  \nSTORAGE:\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30C in a dry place.

      "drug_interactions": "Drug Interactions: Although the pressor activity of desmo-pressin acetate are very low compared to its antidiuretic activity, large doses of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets should be used with other pressor agents only with careful patient monitoring. The concomitant administration of drugs that may increase the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin re-uptake inqibitors, chlorpromazine, opiate analgesics, NSAIDs, lamotrigine and carbamazepine) should be performed with caution. \nNursing Mothers: There have been no controlled studies in \nnursing mothers. Caution should be exercised when desmopressin acetate is administered to nursing mothers.\nADVERSE REACTIONS Infrequently, large doses of the \nintranasal formulations of Desmopressin Acetate Tablets and \nDesmopressin Acetate Injection have produced transient \nheadache, nausea, flushing and mild abdominal cramps. These \nsymptoms have disappeared with reduction in dosage. \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \nAdults and Children: It is recommended that patients be started \non doses of 0.05 mg (12 of the 0.1 mg tablet) two times a day and individually adjusted to their optimum therapeutic dose. \nMost patients in clinical trials found that the optimal dosage \nrange is 0.1 mg to 0.8 mg daily, administered in divided doses. \nEach dose should be separately adjusted for an adequate \ndiurnal rhythm of water turnover. Total daily dosage should be \nincreased or decreased in the range of 0.1 mg to 1.2 mg divided \ninto two or three daily doses as needed to obtain adequate \nantidiuresis.

      "indications": "Indications\nNutrilive is indicated as a source of amino acids for protein \nsynthesis in patients needing intravenous nutrition. Nutrilive is \nparticularly suitable for patients with basal amino acid requirements. \nNutrilive is also indicated for faster recovery in massive protein loss \nas in wounds, burns, fractures, purulence & surgery, gastrointestinal \ndisorders causing reduced protein absorption, malnutrition, including \nstarvation, renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, chronic or acute \ninfectious diseases where parenteral nutrition is needed, effective \nmanagement of cancer.",
      "dosage": "Dosage\nAdults: \nThe nitrogen requirement for maintenance of body protein mass \ndepends on the patients condition (nutritional state and degree of \nmetabolic stress). \nThe requirements are :\n0.10-0.15g nitrogenkgday (no or minor metabolic stress and normal \nnutritional state) \n0.15-0.20g nitrogenkgday (moderate metabolic stress with or \nwithout malnutrition) and \nup to 0.20-0.25g nitrogenkgday (severe catabolism as in burns, \nsepsis and trauma). \nThe dosage range 0.10-0.25g nitrogenkgday corresponds to 15-35 \nml Nutrilivekgday. \nIn obese patients, the dose should be based on the estimated ideal weight. Depending upon patients requirements, 1000-2000 ml \nNutrilive may be infused intravenously per 24 hours. Nutrilive \nshould be infused slowly, at rates 2-4 ml (30-60 drops) per minute. \nInfants and children:\nIn children and infants, an infusion rate of 28-35 mlkg body weight \nper day is recommended, with a stepwise increase in the rate of administration during the first week.\nAdverse Effects\nNutrilive is usually well tolerated. Yet nausea, vomiting, flushing and \nsweating have been observed during infusion of Nutrilive at rates \nexceeding the recommended maximal rate. Hypersensitivity reactions \nhave been reported. As with all hypertonic infusion solution, \nthrombophlebitis may occur when peripheral veins are used. The \nincidence may be reduced by the simultaneous infusion of 10 fat \nemulsion.

      "indications": "Indications\nFor the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer \ndisease, for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in peptic ulceration \n(triple therapy), acid related dyspepsia, NSAID associated duodenal \nor gastric ulcer and gastroduodenal erosions, Zollinger-Ellison \nSyndrome.\nProperties\nOpal (Omeprazole) inhibits secretion of gastric acid by irreversibly \nblocking the enzyme system of hydrogenpotassium adenosine \ntriphosphatase (HKATPase), the proton pump of the gastric \nparietal cell oral dosing with Opal, produces inhibition of gastric \nacid secretion within 1-2 hours of the first dose. The maximum effect \nis achieved within 4 days of starting of treatment after which the \ndegree of acid inhibition remains constant.\nPharmacokinetics\nOmeprazole is rapidly absorbed. Absorption is not affected by food. \nOmerazole is acid labile. The absorption of Omeprazole also appears \nto be dose dependent. Bioavailability of Omeprazole may be increased \nin elderly patients and in patients with impaired hepatic function. \nFollowing absorption Omeprazole is almost completely metabolised \nin the liver by cytochrome P 450 and rapidly eliminated in the urine.  \nThe elimination half life is about 0.5 to 3 hours, its duration of action \nwith regard to inhibition of acid secretion is much longer allowing it \nto be used in single daily doses. Omeprazole is highly bound (about \n95) to plasma proteins.",
      "dosage": "Dosage and administration\nCapsule: The usual dose of Opal for the treatment of gastro-\noesophageal reflux disease is 20-40 mg daily for 4 to 12 weeks; There \nafter maintenance therapy can be continued with 20 mg daily.\nIn the management of peptic ulcer disease a single daily dose of 20 \nmg or in severe cases, 40 mg is given. Treatment is continued for 4 \nweeks for duodenal ulcer and 8 weeks for gastric ulcer. A dose of 20 \nmg once daily may be given for maintenance.\nFor the eradication of Helicobacter pylori in peptic ulceration, Opal \n(Omeprazole) 40 mg daily in divided doses may be combined with \nantibacterial in triple therapy.\nDoses of 20 mg daily are used in the  treatment of ulceration \nassociated with the use of NSAID. A dose of 20 mg daily may also be \nused for prophylaxis in susceptible patients.\nThe recommended initial doses for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is 60 \nmg (3 caps. of Opal 20) once daily. The dosage should be adjusted \nindividually and treatment continued as long as clinically indicated. \nDoses upto 120 mg three times daily have been administered. The \nmajority of patients are effectively controlled by doses in the range \n20 to 120 mg daily. With doses above 80 mg daily, the dose should be \ndivided and given twice daily.\nFor the relief of acid related dyspepsia Omeprazole is given in usual \ndoses of 20 mg daily for 2 to 4 weeks.\nInjection: Duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer and reflux oesophagitis: \nPatients who cannot be given oral medication can be treated \nparenterally with 40 mg once daily. The usual treatment period before \ntransfer to oral treatment is 2-3 days. In Zollinger-Ellison syndrome \nthe dose should be adjusted individually. Higher doses andor several \ndoses daily may be required. Intravenous treatment can be given as \nan infusion over a period of 20-30 minutes. After reconstitution start \nthe infusion immediately.\nElderly and impaired hepatic function\nAs bioavailability and half life can be increased in patients with \nimpaired hepatic function as well as elderly, the dose requires \nadjustment with a maximum daily dose of 20 mg.\nImpaired renal function\nDose adjustment is not required in patients with impaired renal function.\nMethod of administration\nOpal IV injection 40 mg should be given as a slow intravenous \ninjection. The solution for IV injection is obtained by adding to the \nvial 10 ml of the solvent provided. (No other solvent should be used). \nDiscoloration may occur if incorrect reconstitution technique is used. For practical information about the reconstitution see the package \ninsert. After reconstitution the injection should be given slowly over a \nperiod of at least 2.5 minutes at a maximum rate of 4 ml per minute. \nThe solution should be used within 4 hours of reconstitution.",

      "contraindications": "Contraindications\nThere are no known contraindications to the use of Omeprazole. \nBefore giving Omeprazole to patients with gastric ulcers the \npossibility of malignancy should be considered since Omeprazole \nmay mask symptoms and delay diagnosis.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation\nThere is no evidence on the safety of Omeprazole in human \npregnancy. Animal studies have revealed no teratogenic effect. There \nis no information available on the passage of Omeprazole into milk or \nits effects on the neonate. Breast feeding should therefore be \ndiscontinued if the use of Omeprazole is considered essential.\nAdverse reactions\nOpal is well tolerated and adverse reactions have generally been \nmild and reversible. The following have been reported as adverse \nevents in clinical trials or reported from routine use but in many  \ncases a relationship to treatment with Omeprazole has not been \nestablished. Skin rash, urticaria and pruritus have been reported, \nusually resolving after discontinuation of treatment, in addition \nphotosensitivity, bollous eruption, erythema, multiform, angioedema \nand alopecia have been reported in isolated cases. Diarrhhoea and \nheadache have been reported. In the majority of cases the symptoms \nresolved after discontinuation of therapy. \nOther gastrointestinal reaction includes constipation, nausea, vomiting, \nflatulence and abdominal pain. Stomatitis and candidiasis have been \nreported as isolated cases. Paraesthesia have been reported Dizziness, \nlightheadedness and feeling faint have been associated with \ntreatment, but all usually resolve on cessation of therapy.\nAlso reported are somnolence, insomnia and vertigo. Reversible \nmental confusion, agitation, depression and hallucinations have \noccurred predominantly in severely ill patients. Arthritic and myalgic \nsymptoms have been reported and have usually resolved when \ntherapy is stopped.\nIn isolated cases the following have been reported: blurred vision, \ntaste disturbance, peripheral edema, increased sweating, \ngynaecomastia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, malaise, fever, \nbronchospasm, encephalopathy in patients with pre-existing severe \nliver disease, hepatitis with or without jaundice, rarely interstitial \nnephritis and hepatic failure. Increase in liver enzymes have been \nobserved.\nInteractions\nOpal can delay the elimination of diazepam, phenytoin and warfarin. \nMonitoring of patients receiving warfarin or phenytoin is \nrecommended and a reduction of warfarin or phenytoin dose may be \nnecessary when Omeprazole is added to treatment. There is no \nevidence of an interaction with theophylline, propranolol, metoprolol, \nlidocaine, quinidine, amoxycillin or antacids. The absorption of Opal \nis not affected by alcohol or food.\nSimultaneous treatment with Omeprazole and digoxin in healthy \nsubjects lead to a 10  increase in the bioavailability of digoxin as a \nconsequence of the increased intragastric pH.\nHow Supply\nOpal 20 mg capsules: Box containing 10x6 capsules in Alu-Alu \nblister pack.\nOpal 40 mg capsules: Box containing 8x4 capsules in Alu-Alu \nblister pack.\nOpal 40 mg i.v. injection: Each combipack contains 1 vial of 40 mg \nof Omeprazole, 1 ampoule of 10 ml sterile water for injection and 1 \nsterile disposable syringe 10 ml. \nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30 ºC in a dry place.

Topotecan binds to the \ntopoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents religation of \nthese single strand breaks. Topotecan mimics a DNA base \npair and binds at the site of DNA cleavage by intercalating \nbetween the upstream (-1) and downstream (1) base pairs. \nIntercalation displaces the downstream DNA, thus preventing \nreligation of the cleaved strand. By specifically binding to the \nenzymesubstrate complex, Topotecan acts as an \nuncompetitive inhibitor.\nTHERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS\nTopotecan is indicated in the treatment of-\n  Small Cell Lung Cancer\n  Cervical Cancer  \nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \n  Small Cell Lung Cancer:  1.5 mgm2 by intravenous  \ninfusion over 30 minutes daily for 5 consecutive days, starting \non day 1 of a 21-day course. \n Cervical cancer:  0.75 mgm2 by intravenous infusion over \n30 minutes on days 1, 2, and 3 repeated every 21 days in \ncombination with cisplatin 50 mgm2 on day 1\n Renal impairment:  Dose reduce topotecan injection in \npatients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 20 to 39 \nmLmin)     \nCONTRAINDICATIONS\n Topotecan can cause severe bone marrow depression (e.g. \nbaseline neutrophil count of 1000 cellsmm3, platelets \nrecover to 100,000 cellsmm3 and haemoglobin levels \nrecover to 9.0 gdl (with transfusion if needed).

      "composition": "Composition\n250 mg i.v.  i.m. injection:  Each vial contains Ceftriaxone Sodium USP 298.23 mg \nequivalent to Ceftriaxone 250 mg.\n500 mg i.v.  i.m. injection:  Each vial contains Ceftriaxone Sodium USP 596.46 mg \nequivalent to Ceftriaxone 500 mg.\n1 g i.v.  i.m. injection: Each vial contains Ceftriaxone Sodium USP 1.193 g equivalent to Ceftriaxone 1 g.2 g i.v. infusion:  Each vial contains Ceftriaxone Sodium USP 2.386 g equivalent to \nCeftriaxone 2 g.\nSolvent for parenteral use: The solvent ampoule for i.m. injection contains 1 lidocaine \nhydrochloride solution, and for i.v. injection sterile water for injections. \nPharmacology\nThe bactericidal activity of ceftriaxone results from inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Ceftriaxone exerts in-vitro activity against a wide range of gram-negative and \ngram-positive microorganisms. Ceftriaxone is highly stable to most \nβ-lactamases, both \npenicillinases and cephalosporinases, of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. \nCeftriaxone is usually active against the following microorganisms in vitro and in clinical infections (see Indications and usage.):\nGram-positive aerobes:\nStaphylococcus aureus (Including penicillancase Producing strains)\nStaphylococci epidermisStreptococcus pneumoniaeStreptococcus group A (Str. pyogenes)Streptococcus group B (Str. agalactiae)\nStreptococcus viridans\nStreptococcus bovis\nGram-negative aerobes:\nAeromonas spp.Alcaligenes spp.\nBranhamella catarrhalis (\nβ-lactamase negative and positive)\nCitrobacter spp.\nEnterobacter spp. (some strains are resistant)Escherichia coliHaemophilus ducreyi\nHaemophilus influenzae (including penicillinase-producing strains)\nHaemophilus parainfluenzae (including penicillinase-producing strains)Klebsiella spp. (including Kl. pneumoniae)Moraxella spp.\nMorganella morganii\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae (including penicillinase-producing strains)Neisseria meningitidisPlesiomonas shigelloides\nProteus mirabilis \nProteus vulgarisProvidencia spp.Pseudomonas aeruginosa (some strains are resistant)\nSalmonella spp. (including S. typhi)\nSerratia spp. (including S. marcescens)Shigella spp.Vibrio spp. (including V . cholerae)\nYersinia spp. (including Y. enterocolitica)\nNote:  Many strains of the above microorganisms that are multiple resistant to other \nantibiotics, e.g. penicillins older cephalosporins and aminoglycosides, are susceptible to \nceftriaxone.\nTreponema pallidum  is sensitive in vitro and in animal experiments. Clinical \ninvestigations indicate that primary and secondary syphilis respond well to ceftriaxone \ntherapy. With a few exceptions clinical P. aeruginosa isolates are resistant to ceftriaxone.\nAnaerobic organisms\nBacteroides spp. (including some strains of B. fragilis)\nClostridium spp. (except Cl. difficile)Fusobacterium spp. (except F. mortiferum and F. varium)Peptococcus spp.\nPeptostreptococcus spp.\nNote: Many strains of \nβ-lactamase-producing Bacteroides spp. (notably B. fragilis) are \nresistant.\nSusceptibility to ceftriaxone can be determined by the disk diffusion test or by the agar or \nbroth dilution test using standardized  techniques for susceptibility testing such as those \nrecommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). The NCCLS issued the following interpretative breakpoints for ceftriaxone: ________________________________________________________\n Susceptible Moderately Resistant   \nsusceptible\n________________________________________________________\nDilution test__________\ninhibitory concentrations 8 16-32 64in mgl________________________________________________________\nDiffusion test___________ \n(disk with 30 mg ceftriaxone), 21 20-14  13inhibition zone diameterin mm________________________________________________________\nMicroorganisms should be tested with the ceftriaxone disk since it has been shown by \nin-vitro tests to be active against certain strains resistant to cephalosporin class disks. Where NCCLS recommendations are not in daily use, alternative, well standardized \nsusceptibility-interpretative guidelines such as those issued by DIN, ICS and others may \nbe substituted.\nPharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone are nonlinear and all basic pharmacokinetic parameters, except the elimination half-life, are dose dependent if based on total drug \nconcentrations.\nAbsorption\nThe maximum plasma concentration after a single i.m. dose of 1g is about 81 mgl and is reached in 2-3 hours after administration. The area under the plasma concentration-time \ncurve after i.m. administration is equivalent to that after i.v. administration of an \nequivalent dose, indicating 100 bioavailability of intramuscularly administered ceftriaxone.\nDistribution\nThe volume of distribution of ceftriaxone is 7-12 l. Ceftriaxone has shown excellent tissue and body fluid penetration after a dose of 1-2 g; concentrations well above the \nminimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens responsible for infection are \ndetectable for more than 24 hours in over 60 tissues or body fluids including lung, heart, \nbiliary tractliver, tonsil, middle ear and nasal mucosa, bone as well as cerebrospinal, \npleural, prostatic and synovial fluids.\nOn intravenous administration, ceftriaxone diffuses rapidly into the interstitial fluid, \nwhere bactericidal concentrations against susceptible organisms are maintained for 24 \nhours (see figure). \nConcentration after 1 g ceftriaxone (mgl)\nProtein binding \nCeftriaxone is reversibly bound to albumin, and the binding decreases with the \nincrease in concentration, e.g. from 95 binding at plasma concentrations of 100 mg1 \nto 85 binding at 300 mg1. Owing to the lower albumin content, the proportion of free \nceftriaxone in interstitial fluid is correspondingly higher than in plasma.\nPenetration into particular tissues \nCeftriaxone penetrates the inflamed meninges of neonates, infants and children: \nCeftriaxone concentrations exceed 1.4 mgl in the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) 24 hours \nafter i.v. injection of Oricef\n in doses of 50-100 mgkg (neonates and infants \nrespectively). Peak concentration in CSF is reached about 4 hours after i.v. injection and gives an average value of 18 mgl. Mean CSF levels are 17 of plasma concentrations in patients with bacterial meningitis and 4 in patients with aseptic meningitis. \nIn adult meningitis patients, administration of 50 mgkg leads within 2-24 hours to CSF \nconcentrations several times higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations \nrequired for the most common meningitis pathogens. \nMetabolism\nCeftriaxone is not metabolized systemically; but is converted to inactive metabolites by \nthe gut flora.\nElimination\n50-60 of ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine, while 40-50 is excreted \nunchanged in the bile. The elimination half-life in adults is about 8 hours. \nPharmacokinetics in special clinical situations\nIn neonates, urinary recovery accounts for about 70 of the dose. In infants aged less \nthan 8 days and in elderly persons aged over 75 years the average elimination half-life is \nusually two to three times that in young adults.\nIn patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone are \nonly minimally altered and the elimination half-life is only slightly increased. If kidney function alone is impaired, biliary elimination of ceftriaxone is increased; if liver \nfunction alone is impaired, renal elimination is increased. \nIndications & Usage\nInfections caused by pathogens sensitive to Oricef\n, e.g.: \n- sepsis;\n- meningitis; \n- abdominal infections (peritonitis, infections of the biliary and gastrointestinal tracts);\n- infections of the bones, joints, soft tissue, skin and of wounds;- infections in patients with  impaired defence mechanisms;\n- renal and urinary tract infections;\n- respiratory tract infections, particularly pneumonia, and ear, nose and throat \ninfections;\n- genital infections, including gonorrhoea.\nPerioperative prophylaxis of infections.\nDosage and administration\nRoute of administration: ParenteralStandard dosage\nAdults and children over 12 years: The usual dosage is 1-2 g of Oricef\n once daily (every 24 \nhours). In severe cases or in infections caused by moderately sensitive organisms, the \ndosage may be raised to 4 g, once daily.\nElderly patients: The dosages recommended for adults require no modification in the \ncase of geriatric patients.\nDuration of therapy\nThe duration of therapy varies according to the course of the disease. As with antibiotic therapy in general, administration of Oricef\n should be continued for a minimum of \n48-72 hours after the patient has become afebrile or evidence of bacterial eradication has \nbeen obtained.\nCombination therapy\nSynergy between ceftriaxone and aminoglycosides has been demonstrated with many \ngram-negative bacilli under experimental conditions. Although enhanced activity of such \ncombinations is not always predictable, it should be considered in severe, life threatening \ninfections due to microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Because of physical incompatibility the two drugs must be administered separately at the recommended \ndosages.\nSpecial dosage instructions\nMeningitis: In bacterial meningitis in infants and children, treatment begins with doses of 100 mgkg (not to exceed 4 g) once daily. As soon  as the causative organism has been \nidentified and its sensitivity determined, the dosage can be reduced accordingly. The best \nresults have been found with the following duration of therapy: ________________________________________________________\nNeisseria meningitidis 4 days\nHaemophilus influenzae 6 days\nStreptococcus pneumoniae 7 days\nSusceptible Enterobacteriaceae 10-14 days________________________________________________________\nLyme borreliosis: 50 mgkg up to a maximum of 2 g in children and adults, once daily for \n14 days.\nGonorrhoea(penicillinase-producing and nonpenicillinase-producing strains):\nFor the treatment, a single i.m. dose of 250 mg Oricef\n is recommended.\nPerioperative prophylaxis: A single dose of 1-2 g depending on the risk of infection of 30-90 minutes prior to surgery. In colorectal surgery, administration of Oricef\n with or \nwithout a 5-nitroimidazole, e.g. ornidazole (separate administration, see Method of \nadministration) has been proven effective. \nImpaired renal and hepatic function: In patients with impaired renal function, there is no \nneed to reduce the dosage of Oricef provided hepatic function is intact. Only in cases of \npreterminal renal failure (creatinine clearance 10 mlmin) should the Oricef dosage \nnot exceed 2 g daily. In patients with liver damage, there is no need for the dosage to be reduced provided renal function is intact.\nIn patients with both severe renal and hepatic dysfunction, the plasma concentrations of \nceftriaxone should be determined at regular intervals and if necessary the dose should be adjusted.In patients undergoing dialysis no additional supplementary dosing is required following the dialysis. Plasma concentrations should , however, be monitored, to determine \nwhether dosage adjustments are necessary, since the elimination rate in these patients \nmay be altered.\nMethod of administration\nAs a general rule the solutions should be used immediately after preparation. Reconstituted solutions retain their physical and chemical stability for six hours at room temperature (or 24 hours at 5 ºC). The solutions range in colour from pale yellow to \namber, depending on the concentration and the length of storage.  The colouration of the solutions is of no significance for the efficacy or tolerance of the drug. \nIntramuscular injection: For i.m. injection, Oricef\n 250 mg or 500 mg is dissolved in 2 ml, \nand Oricef 1 g in 3.5 ml, of 1 lidocaine hydrochloride solution and administered by \ndeep intragluteal injection. It is recommended that not more than 1 g be injected at one \nsite. \nThe lidocaine solution must never be administered intravenously.\nIntravenous injection: For i.v. injection, Oricef 250 mg or 500 mg is dissolved in 5 ml & \nOricef 1 g in 10 ml sterile water for injections, and then administered by i.v. injection \nlasting for 2-4 minutes.\nExamine the patients tolerance to ceftriaxone by giving test dose prior to administration.\nIntravenous infusion: The infusion should last at least 30 minutes. For i.v. infusion, 2 g \nOricef is dissolved in 40 ml of one of the following calcium-free infusion solutions: \nsodium chloride 0.9, sodium chloride 0.45  dextrose 2.5, dextrose 5, dextrose 10, levulose 5, dextran 6 in dextrose, sterile water for injections. Oricef\n solutions \nshould not be mixed with or piggybacked into solutions containing other antimicrobial drugs or into diluent solutions other than those listed above, owing to possible incompatibility.\nStability \nThis medicine should not be used after the expiry date (EXP) shown on the pack. \nReconstituted solutions retain their physical and chemical stability for 6 hours at room temperature or 24 hours in the refrigerator at 2-8 ºC.\nContraindications\nOricef\n is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the cephalosporin \nclass of antibiotics. In patients hypersensitive to penicillin, the possibility of allergic \ncross-reactions should be borne in mind. Although the relevant preclinical investigations revealed neither mutagenic nor \nteratogenic effects, Oricef\n should not be used in pregnancy (particularly in the first \ntrimester) unless absolutely indicated.\nWarning and Precautions\nAs with other cephalosporins, anaphylactic shock cannot be ruled out even if a thorough \npatient history is taken. Anaphylactic shock requires immediate countermeasures such as \nintravenous epinephrine followed by a glucocorticoid. In rare cases, shadows suggesting sludge have been detected by sonograms of the gallbladder. This condition was reversible on discontinuation or completion of \nceftriaxone therapy . Even if such findings are associated with pain, conservative, \nnonsurgical management is recommended. In-vitro studies have shown that ceftriaxone, like some other cephalosporins, can displace bilirubin from serum albumin. Cautions should be exercised when considering Oricef\n for hyperbilirubinemic neonates, especially \nprematures. During prolonged treatment the blood picture should be checked at regular intervals.\nUndesirable effects \nOricef\n is generally well tolerated. During the use of Oricef, the following side effects, \nwhich were reversible either spontaneously or after withdrawal of the drug, have been observed:\nSystemic side effects\nNeuropsychiatric symptom such as convulsion.\nGastrointestinal complaints (about 2 of cases) : loose stools or diarrhea, nausea, \nvomiting, stomatitis and glossitis. Hematological changes (about 2): eosinophilia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia. \nSkin reactions (about 1) : exanthema, allergic dermatitis, pruritus, urticaria, edema, \nerythema multiforme. Other, rare side effects: headache and dizziness, increase in liver enzymes, gallbladder sludge, oliguria, increase in serum creatinine, mycosis of the genital tract, shivering and \nanaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions. \nPseudomembranous enterocolitis and coagulation disorders have been reported as very rare side effects.\nLocal side effects\nIn rare cases, phlebitic reactions occurred after i.v. administration. These may be \nminimized by slow (two to four minutes) injection.\nIntramuscular injection without lidocaine solution is painful. \nUse in pregnancy & lactation\nPregnancy Category B . Ceftriaxone crosses the placental barrier and is excreted in the \nbreast milk at low concentrations.\nUse in children & adolescents\nNeonates, infants and children up to 12 years:  The following dosage schedules are \nrecommended for once daily administration: Neonates (up to 14 days): A daily dose of 20-50 mgkg body weight, not to exceed 50 \nmgkg, on account of the immaturity of the infants enzyme systems. It is not necessary \nto differentiate between premature and term infants. \nInfants and children (15 days to 12 years): A daily dose of 20-80 mgkg.  \nFor children with body weights of 50 kg or more, the usual adult dosage should be used. \nIntravenous doses of 50 mgkg body weight should be given by infusion over at least 30 \nminutes.\nDrug interactions\na) With Medicine: No impairment of renal function has so far been observed after \nconcurrent administration of large doses of ceftriaxone and potent diuretics (e.g. furosemide). There is no evidence that Oricef\n increases renal toxicity of \naminoglycosides. No effect similar to that of disulfiram has been demonstrated after ingestion of alcohol subsequent to the administration of Oricef\n. Ceftriaxone does not \ncontain an N-methylthiotetrazole moiety associated with possible ethanol intolerance and bleeding problems of certain other cephalosporins. The elimination of Oricef\n is not \naltered by probenecid.\nb) With food & others: No\nOverdose\nIn the case of overdosage, drug concentration would not be reduced by hemodialysis or \nperitoneal  dialysis.

The NCCLS issued the following interpretative breakpoints for ceftriaxone: ________________________________________________________\n Susceptible Moderately Resistant   \nsusceptible\n________________________________________________________\nDilution test__________\ninhibitory concentrations 8 16-32 64in mgl________________________________________________________\nDiffusion test___________ \n(disk with 30 mg ceftriaxone), 21 20-14  13inhibition zone diameterin mm________________________________________________________\nMicroorganisms should be tested with the ceftriaxone disk since it has been shown by \nin-vitro tests to be active against certain strains resistant to cephalosporin class disks. Where NCCLS recommendations are not in daily use, alternative, well standardized \nsusceptibility-interpretative guidelines such as those issued by DIN, ICS and others may \nbe substituted.\nPharmacokinetics\nThe pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone are nonlinear and all basic pharmacokinetic parameters, except the elimination half-life, are dose dependent if based on total drug \nconcentrations.\nAbsorption\nThe maximum plasma concentration after a single i.m. dose of 1g is about 81 mgl and is reached in 2-3 hours after",
      "dosage": "Dosage and administration. The area under the plasma concentration-time \ncurve after i.m. administration is equivalent to that after i.v. administration of an \nequivalent dose, indicating 100 bioavailability of intramuscularly administered ceftriaxone.\nDistribution\nThe volume of distribution of ceftriaxone is 7-12 l. Ceftriaxone has shown excellent tissue and body fluid penetration after a dose of 1-2 g; concentrations well above the \nminimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens responsible for infection are \ndetectable for more than 24 hours in over 60 tissues or body fluids including lung, heart, \nbiliary tractliver, tonsil, middle ear and nasal mucosa, bone as well as cerebrospinal, \npleural, prostatic and synovial fluids.\nOn intravenous administration, ceftriaxone diffuses rapidly into the interstitial fluid, \nwhere bactericidal concentrations against susceptible organisms are maintained for 24 \nhours (see figure). \nConcentration after 1 g ceftriaxone (mgl)\nProtein binding \nCeftriaxone is reversibly bound to albumin, and the binding decreases with the \nincrease in concentration, e.g. from 95 binding at plasma concentrations of 100 mg1 \nto 85 binding at 300 mg1. Owing to the lower albumin content, the proportion of free \nceftriaxone in interstitial fluid is correspondingly higher than in plasma.\nPenetration into particular tissues \nCeftriaxone penetrates the inflamed meninges of neonates, infants and children: \nCeftriaxone concentrations exceed 1.4 mgl in the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) 24 hours \nafter i.v. injection of Oricef\n in doses of 50-100 mgkg (neonates and infants \nrespectively). Peak concentration in CSF is reached about 4 hours after i.v. injection and gives an average value of 18 mgl. Mean CSF levels are 17 of plasma concentrations in patients with bacterial meningitis and 4 in patients with aseptic meningitis. \nIn adult meningitis patients, administration of 50 mgkg leads within 2-24 hours to CSF \nconcentrations several times higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations \nrequired for the most common meningitis pathogens. \nMetabolism\nCeftriaxone is not metabolized systemically; but is converted to inactive metabolites by \nthe gut flora.\nElimination\n50-60 of ceftriaxone is excreted unchanged in the urine, while 40-50 is excreted \nunchanged in the bile. The elimination half-life in adults is about 8 hours. \nPharmacokinetics in special clinical situations\nIn neonates, urinary recovery accounts for about 70 of the dose. In infants aged less \nthan 8 days and in elderly persons aged over 75 years the average elimination half-life is \nusually two to three times that in young adults.\nIn patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone are \nonly minimally altered and the elimination half-life is only slightly increased. If kidney function alone is impaired, biliary elimination of ceftriaxone is increased; if liver \nfunction alone is impaired, renal elimination is increased. \nIndications & Usage\nInfections caused by pathogens sensitive to Oricef\n, e.g.: \n- sepsis;\n- meningitis; \n- abdominal infections (peritonitis, infections of the biliary and gastrointestinal tracts);\n- infections of the bones, joints, soft tissue, skin and of wounds;- infections in patients with  impaired defence mechanisms;\n- renal and urinary tract infections;\n- respiratory tract infections, particularly pneumonia, and ear, nose and throat \ninfections;\n- genital infections, including gonorrhoea.\nPerioperative prophylaxis of infections.\nDosage and administration\nRoute of administration: ParenteralStandard dosage\nAdults and children over 12 years: The usual dosage is 1-2 g of Oricef\n once daily (every 24 \nhours). In severe cases or in infections caused by moderately sensitive organisms, the \ndosage may be raised to 4 g, once daily.\nElderly patients: The dosages recommended for adults require no modification in the \ncase of geriatric patients.\nDuration of therapy\nThe duration of therapy varies according to the course of the disease. As with antibiotic therapy in general, administration of Oricef\n should be continued for a minimum of \n48-72 hours after the patient has become afebrile or evidence of bacterial eradication has \nbeen obtained.\nCombination therapy\nSynergy between ceftriaxone and aminoglycosides has been demonstrated with many \ngram-negative bacilli under experimental conditions. Although enhanced activity of such \ncombinations is not always predictable, it should be considered in severe, life threatening \ninfections due to microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Because of physical incompatibility the two drugs must be administered separately at the recommended \ndosages.\nSpecial dosage instructions\nMeningitis: In bacterial meningitis in infants and children, treatment begins with doses of 100 mgkg (not to exceed 4 g) once daily. As soon  as the causative organism has been \nidentified and its sensitivity determined, the dosage can be reduced accordingly. The best \nresults have been found with the following duration of therapy: ________________________________________________________\nNeisseria meningitidis 4 days\nHaemophilus influenzae 6 days\nStreptococcus pneumoniae 7 days\nSusceptible Enterobacteriaceae 10-14 days________________________________________________________\nLyme borreliosis: 50 mgkg up to a maximum of 2 g in children and adults, once daily for \n14 days.\nGonorrhoea(penicillinase-producing and nonpenicillinase-producing strains):\nFor the treatment, a single i.m. dose of 250 mg Oricef\n is recommended.\nPerioperative prophylaxis: A single dose of 1-2 g depending on the risk of infection of 30-90 minutes prior to surgery. In colorectal surgery, administration of Oricef\n with or \nwithout a 5-nitroimidazole, e.g. ornidazole (separate administration, see Method of \nadministration) has been proven effective. \nImpaired renal and hepatic function: In patients with impaired renal function, there is no \nneed to reduce the dosage of Oricef provided hepatic function is intact. Only in cases of \npreterminal renal failure (creatinine clearance 10 mlmin) should the Oricef dosage \nnot exceed 2 g daily. In patients with liver damage, there is no need for the dosage to be reduced provided renal function is intact.\nIn patients with both severe renal and hepatic dysfunction, the plasma concentrations of \nceftriaxone should be determined at regular intervals and if necessary the dose should be adjusted.In patients undergoing dialysis no additional supplementary dosing is required following the dialysis. Plasma concentrations should , however, be monitored, to determine \nwhether dosage adjustments are necessary, since the elimination rate in these patients \nmay be altered.\nMethod of administration\nAs a general rule the solutions should be used immediately after preparation. Reconstituted solutions retain their physical and chemical stability for six hours at room temperature (or 24 hours at 5 ºC). The solutions range in colour from pale yellow to \namber, depending on the concentration and the length of storage.

Like oxytocin, Oxagon \nselectively binds to oxytocin receptors in the smooth muscle \nof the uterus, stimulates rhythmic contractions of the uterus, \nincreases the frequency of existing contractions, and raises \nthe tone of the uterus musculature.\nOn the postpartum uterus, Oxagon is capable of increasing \nthe rate and force of spontaneous uterine contractions. The \nonset of uterine contraction following Oxagon is rapid, with a \nfirm contraction being obtained within 2 minutes.A single 100 micrograms intravenous dose of \nOxagon \nadministered after the delivery of the infant is sufficient to \nmaintain adequate uterine contraction that prevents uterine \natony and excessive bleeding comparable with an oxytocin \ninfusion lasting for several hours.\nINDICATIONS\nOxagon is indicated for the prevention of uterine atony and \nexcessive bleeding following delivery of the infant by elective \ncaesarean section under epidural or spinal anaesthesia.\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\nA single intravenous dose of 100 micrograms (1 ml) of \nOxagon Injection is administered by bolus injection, slowly \nover 1 minute, only when delivery of the infant has been \ncompleted by caesarean section under epidural or spinal \nanaesthesia.\nOxagon can be administered as a single dose only before or \nafter delivery of the placenta.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\nShould not be used in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to oxytocin or \nOxagon or any of the \nexcepients, patients with vascular disease, especially coronary \nartery disease, hepatic or renal disease.\nPRECAUTION\nOxagon should be used cautiously in the presence of \nepilepsy, migraine, asthma and cardiovascular disease or any \nstate in which a rapid addition to extracellular water may \nproduce hazard for an already overburdened system. Patients \nwith eclampsia and pre-eclampsia should be monitored for \nchanges in blood pressure.\nSIDE EFFECTS\nIntravenous Oxagon is frequently (10-40 of patients) \nassociated with nausea, abdominal pain, pruritis, flushing, \nvomiting, feeling of warmth, hypotension, headache and \ntremor.\nInfrequent adverse events (1-5 patients) included back pain, dizziness, metallic taste, anaemia, sweating, chest pain, dyspnea, chills, tachycardia and anxiety.\nUSE IN PREGNANCY AND LACTATION\nThe safety of \nOxagon in women who are or who may become \npregnant has not been established. Potential benefits should \nbe weighted against possible hazards. Small amounts of \nOxagon have been shown to cross over from plasma into the breast milk of nursing women who were given a 70 mcg dose \nintramuscularly, between 7 and 14 weeks postpartum. The \nsmall amount of Oxagon transferred into breast milk or \ncolostrum after a single injection, and subsequently ingested by a breast feeding infant, would not be expected to present a \nsignificant safety concern. This is due to the fact that \nOxagon \nwould be rapidly degraded by peptidases in the infant \ngastrointestinal tract.\nDRUG INTERACTIONS\nNo specific drug interactions have been reported with \nOxagon.\nOVERDOSE\nOverdosage of Oxagon may produce uterine hyperactivity \nwhether or not due to hypersensitivity to this agent.\nHyperstimulation with strong (hypertonic) or prolonged \n(tetanic) contractions resulting from oxytocin overdose can \nlead to uterine rupture or postpartum haemorrhage.\nOverdosage of oxytocin may lead to hyponatraemia and water \nintoxication in severe cases, especially when associated with \nexcessive concomitant fluid intake.\nSTORAGE\nOxagon Injection: Store in a refrigerator (2-8 ºC). Protect from light. \nDo not freeze.\nOnce the ampoule has been opened, the product should be used \nimmediately.\nHOW SUPPLIED\nOxagon Injection: Each box contains 100 mcg Carbetocin in 1 \nampoule.\n  Medicine:  Keep out of reach of children\n13001773Oxagon\nCarbetocin INN 100 mcg\nManufactured by\nHealthcare Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\nGazariapara, Rajendrapur\nGazipur-1703, Bangladesh",

Doxofylline  selectively \ninhibits phosphodiesterase-4 enzyme thereby relaxes bronchial \nsmooth muscle. Moreover Doxofylline  appears to have a less affinity \ntowards adenosine A1 & A2 receptor which accounts for a better \nsafety profile of the drug. Doxofylline  is reported to inhibit platelet \nactivating factor (PAF) and generation of leukotriene production.\nIndication\nDoxofylline  is indicated for maintenance therapy in patients suffering \nwith Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).\nDosage & Administration\nAdult: 400 mg (1 tablet) daily in the evening. On the basis of clinical \nresponse the dose may be increased to 1 tablet twice daily. The \ndosage may be increased to t.i.d. (400 mg 3 times daily) according to \nthe prescribing physician. In elderly patient with concomitant \ncardiovascular, hepatic and renal diseases recommended dose \nshould be 200 mg twice daily.\nChildren above 6 years of age: The recommended dose of Doxofylline  \nis 6 mgkg body weight twice daily. The dose may be increased up to \n18 mgkg body weight daily on the basis of clinical response. \nSide effects\nDoxofylline  rarely causes serious side effects, however possible side \neffects are similar for taking excess amount of caffeine.

For the symptomatic improvement and healing of gastrointestinal  \n  diseases which require a reduction in acid secretion:\n l Duodenal ulcer\n l  Gastric ulcer\n l Gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n l For the treatment of mild reflux disease and associated  \n  symptoms (e.g. heartburn, acid regurgitation, pain on swallowing)\n l Reflux oesophagitis\n l Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome\n2.

On average \nat about 2.0 hr - 2.5 hr p.a. the maximum serum concentrations of \nabout 1 - 1.5 μgmL (20 mg tablets) and 2 - 3 μgmL (40 mg tablets) \nare achieved, and these values remain constant after multiple",
      "dosage": "Dosage and administration.\nDistribution\nVolume of distribution is about 0.15 Lkg and clearance is about 0.1 \nLhrkg. Terminal half-life is about 1 hr.\nMetabolism and excretion\nThere were a few cases of subjects with delayed elimination. \nBecause of the specific binding of pantoprazole to the proton pumps \nof the parietal cell the elimination half-life does not correlate with the \nmuch longer duration of action (inhibition of acid secretion). \nPharmacokinetics do not vary after single or repeated administration. \nIn the dose range of 10 to 80 mg, the plasma kinetics of pantoprazole \nare virtually linear after both oral and intravenous administration. \nPantoprazoles serum protein binding is about 98. The substance is \nalmost exclusively metabolized in the liver. Renal elimination \nrepresents the major route of excretion (about 80) for the \nmetabolites of pantoprazole, the rest are excreted with the faeces. \nThe main metabolite in both the serum and urine is \ndesmethylpantoprazole which is conjugated with sulphate. The \nhalf-life of the main metabolite (about 1.5 hr) is not much longer \nthan that of pantoprazole.\nBioavailability\nPantoprazole is completely absorbed after oral administration. The \nabsolute bioavailability from the tablet was found to be about 77. \nConcomitant intake of food had no influence on AUC, maximum \nserum concentration and thus bioavailability. Only the variability of \nthe lag-time will be increased by concomitant food intake.\nDosage and Administration\nTablet\nDuodenal Ulcer\nThe recommended oral dosage is one gastro-resistant 40 mg \npantoprazole tablet per day. A duodenal ulcer generally heals within \n2 weeks. If a 2-week period of treatment is not sufficient, healing will \nbe achieved in almost all cases within a further 2 weeks.\nGastric Ulcer\nThe recommended oral dosage is one gastro-resistant 40 mg \npantoprazole tablet per day. A 4-week period is usually required for \nthe treatment of gastric ulcers. If this is not sufficient, healing will \nusually be achieved within a further 4 weeks.\nGERD\nFor mild reflux disease and the associated symptoms, the \nrecommended dosage is one pantoprazole 20 mg tablet per day. \nSymptom relief is generally accomplished within 2-4 weeks. If \nsymptom control has not been achieved after four weeks treatment \nwith pantoprazole 20 mg tablets daily, further investigation is \nrecommended. For treatment of reflux oesophagitis, the \nrecommended oral dosage is one pantoprazole 40 mg tablet per day. \nA 4-week period is usually required for treatment of reflux \noesophagitis, however if this is not sufficient, healing will usually be \nachieved within a further 4 weeks.\nZollinger-Ellison Syndrome\nThe recommended oral dosage is one gastro-resistant pantoprazole \ntablet 40 mg per day. Prevention of gastroduodenal ulcers induced by \nnon-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in \npatients at risk with a need for continuous NSAID treatment. The \nrecommended oral dosage is one gastro-resistant pantoprazole \ntablet 20 mg per day.\nH. pylori Eradication\nIn H. pylori positive patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers, \neradication of the germ by a combination therapy should be \nachieved.\nOne of the following combinations of pantoprazole tablets with \nantibiotics is effective-\n1. twice daily one gastro-resistant 40 mg pantoprazole tablet\n  twice daily 1000 mg amoxycillin\n  twice daily 500 mg clarithromycin\n2. twice daily one gastro-resistant 40 mg pantoprazole tablet\n  twice daily 500 mg metronidazole\n  twice daily 500 mg clarithromycin\n3. twice daily one gastro-resistant 40 mg pantoprazole tablet\n  twice daily 1000 mg amoxycillin\n  twice daily 500 mg metronidazole\nMaintenance\nDuodenal and Gastric Ulcer, and Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome:\nFor long-term management, a maintenance dose of one \ngastro-resistant pantoprazole tablet 40 mg per day is recommended.\nReflux Oesophagitis\nA maintenance dose of one pantoprazole tablet 20 mg per day isrecommended, increasing to 40 mg per day if relapse occurs. After \nhealing of the relapse the dosage can be reduced again to 20 mg.\nExperience with long-term administration in man over several years \nis available in a limited number of patients. Therefore, long-term \ntreatment exceeding 1 year may be considered after careful \nevaluation of the risk benefit ratio. Patients should then be kept \nunder regular surveillance.\nInjection\nIntravenous Pantoprazole should be replaced with oral therapy as \nsoon as possible.\nPreparation for Use\nA ready-to-use solution is prepared by injecting 10 ml 0.9 Sodium \nChloride Intravenous Infusion into the vial containing the dry powder. \nThe resulting solution should be used within 12 hours and stored at \n2-8C.\nAfter preparation, the solution should be administered over 2 to 15 \nminutes.",

Carbonyl iron is 98 pure Iron, virtually non-\ntoxic and easily absorbed in the body. \nIndication:\nPrenat CI is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis \nof iron, folic acid and zinc deficiency specially during \npregnancy and lactation.\nDosage and Administration:\nAdults: 1 capsule daily. In more severe cases, 2 capsules \ndaily may be required.\nElderly: Dosage as above. \nChildren: (Aged over 1 year): 1 capsule daily. The capsule \nmay be opened and the pellets to be mixed with soft cool \nfood, but they must not be chewed.\nContraindication:\nDo not use in patients hypersensitive to the components \nof the product of those with iron overload.\nPrecaution:\nCare should be taken in patients who may develop iron \noverload, such as those with haemochromatosis, \nhaemolytic anemia and red cell aplasia.\nFailure to respond to treatment may indicate other causes \nof anemia and should be further investigated.\nIn patients with renal failure a risk of zinc accumulation \ncould exist.\nUse in Pregnancy:\nAdministration of iron during the first trimester requires \ndefinite evidence of iron deficiency. Prophylaxis of iron \ndeficiency where inadequate diet calls for supplementary \nzinc and folic acid is justified during the remainder of \npregnancy.\nSide effect:\nCarbonyl Iron is less likely to cause constipation and \ndiarrhoea which are significant problems with iron salt \nsupplements. Traditional forms of iron are poorly absorbed \n(less than 1). It is the unabsorbed iron that has a toxic \neffect on the body. The irritation in the lower intestine \ncauses constipation and in some cases diarrhoea, as the \nbody tries to rid itself of the excess iron. Dark stools are \nusual during iron therapy. Nausea and other symptoms of gastrointestinal irritation, such as anorexia, vomiting, \ndiscomfort, constipation and diarrhoea are sometimes \nencountered. Zinc may also produce gastrointestinal \nupset. There have been rare reports of allergic reactions.\nOverdosage:\nIron overdosage is dangerous, particularly in children and \nrequires immediate attention. Gastric lavage should be \ncarried out in the early stages or if this is not possible, \nvomiting should be induced. These procedures should not \nbe undertaken where signs of the corrosive effects of zinc \nare present. In that case give oral desferrioxamine (2gm \nfor a child or 5 gm for an adult) and demulcent. If serum \niron levels at 4 hours or more post ingestion are over 5mg \nl in a child or 8 mg l in an adult, or if the patient is in \ncoma, intravenous desferrioxamine should be used. Zinc \nsulphate in gross overdosage is corrosive. Symptoms are \nthose of gastrointestinal irritation, leading in severe cases \nto haemorrhage, corrosion of the mucosa and possible \nlater stricture formation. Gastric lavage or emesis should \nbe avoided. Demulcent such as milk should be given. \nChelating agents such as dimercaprol, penicillamine or \nedetic acid have been recommended. Symptomatic and \nsupportive measure should be given as required.\nStorage:\nStore in a cool and dry place below 30ºc and protect from \nlight.

      "description": "DESCRIPTION PulmoCare Easycap dry powder inhaler is a preparation of Salbutamol Sulphate. Salbutamol is a relatively selective beta2 adrenoreceptor stimulant. Salbutamol is a sympathomimetic agent which has a highly selective action on beta adrenergic receptors in bronchial muscle. It provides short - acting (4 to 6 hour) bronchodilation with fast onset (within 5 minutes) in reversible airway obstruction. Beta2 adrenoreceptor agonist is used in the treatment of asthma and other forms of diffuse reversible airways obstruction.  INDICATION PulmoCare Easycap (Salbutamol Sulphate) dry powder inhaler is indicated for: n the symptomatic relief and prevention of bronchospasm due to bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and other chronic broncho pulmonary disorders in which bronchospasm is a complicating factor.  n the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm   Pediatrics ( 4 years of age)  n The safety and efficacy in children below the age of 4 years has not been established.                    \n            CONTRAINDICATION n Patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients. n Although intravenous salbutamol, and occasionally salbutamol tablets, is used in the management of premature labour uncomplicated by conditions such as placenta praevia, ante-partum haemorrhage or toxaemia of pregnancy, salbutamol inhaler preparations are not appropriate for managing premature labour. Salbutamol preparation should not be used for threatened abortion during the first or second trimesters of pregnancy.  WARNING & PRECAUTION n Salbutamol and other beta2 agonists should be given with caution in hyperthyroidism, myocardial insufficiency, arrhythmias, susceptibility to QT interval prolongation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. In severe asthma, particular caution is also required to avoid inducing hypokalemia as this effect may be potentiated by hypoxia or by concomitant administration of other anti-asthma drugs: beta2 agonists such as salbutamol are not appropriate for use alone in the treatment of severe asthma. n Salbutamol and non-selective beta blockers such as Propranolol should not be prescribed together. n In the event of a previously effective dose of Salbutamol inhaler, failing to give relief for at least three hours, the patients should be advised to seek medical advice in order that any necessary additional steps may be taken.     SIDE EFFECTS Salbutamol is generally well tolerated and serious toxicologic effects are few. Salbutamol may cause fine tremor of skeletal muscle (particularly of the hands), palpitations, and muscle cramps. Tachycardia, tenseness, headaches, and peripheral vasodilatation have been reported after large dose. They usually disappear with continued treatment. Hypersensitive reactions including angioedema and urticaria, bronchospasm, hypotension and collapse have been reported very rarely. As with all inhalation therapy, the potential for \nparadoxical bronchospasm should be kept in mind. If it occurs, the preparation should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy should be instituted.  PREGNANCY & LACTATION Although there is no evident data, that Salbutamol is teratogenic, it should be used in the first trimester only is absolutely essential. It is pregnancy category C. Salbutamol probably enters into the breast milk, but the concentration is unknown. However, no adverse effects have been reported in the breast-fed babies of mothers taking the drug by inhalations.  DRUG INTERACTION Salbutamol should not be used with Monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants because it may potentiate action of salbutamol on cardiovascular system. Other inhaled sympathomimetic bronchodilators or epinephrine should not be used concomitantly with salbutamol sulphate, as it may lead to deleterious cardiovascular effects. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, especially the non-cardio selective ones, such as propranolol, should not usually be prescribed together because may effectively antagonize the action of salbutamol. Particular caution is advised in acute severe asthma as this effect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics, and by hypoxia. It is recommended that serum potassium levels are monitored in such situations.  OVER DOSAGE The most common signs and symptoms of overdose with salbutamol are transient beta agonist pharmacologically mediated events (see Warnings and Precautions). Over dosage may cause tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, hypokalemia, hypertension and, in extreme cases, sudden death. Serum potassium levels should be monitored.  PHARMACEUTICAL PRECAUTIONS PulmoCare Easycap must not be swallowed. Insert the Easycap in the Easyhaler for best performance. Remove PulmoCare Easycap capsule from the blister pack just prior to use, as Easycap exposed to moisture may not tear easily. Avoid storage in direct sunlight or heat. Store below 30C. Keep away from children.  COMMERCIAL PACK 1. Each box contains 30 PulmoCare Easycap capsules in Alu-Alu blister strips. 2.

      "description": "Description\nPulmoCare-L inhaler is a pressurized metered \ndose inhaler. It is intended for oral inhalations \nonly. It contains Levosalbutamol (as \nLevosalbutamol Sulphate INN) as the active \ningredient which is used in the treatment of \nBronchial Asthma and reversible obstructive \nairway diseases. Levosalbutamol is a beta \nadrenergic agonist which provides short acting \nbronchodilation (4 to 6 hours) and fast onset of \naction (5.5 to 10.2 minutes) in reversible airway \ndiseases.Indication\nPulmoCare-L inhaler is indicated for the \ntreatment or prevention of bronchospasm in \nadults, adolescents and children 4 years of age \nand older with reversible obstructive airway \ndiseases.\nDosage and Administration\nFor treatment of acute episodes of \nbronchospasm or prevention of asthmatic \nsymptoms, the usual dosage of PulmoCare-L \nfor adults and children 4 years of age and older \nis 2 inhalations (100 mcg) repeated every 4 to 6 \nhours; in some patients, 1 inhalation every 4 \nhours may be sufﬁcient. \nMore frequent administration or a larger \nnumber of inhalations is not routinely \nrecommended. If a previously effective dosage \nregimen fails to provide the usual response, this \nmay be a marker of destabilization of asthma \nand requires re-evaluation of the patient and \nthe treatment regimen, giving special \nconsideration to the possible need for \nanti-inﬂammatory treatment, e.g., \ncorticosteroids.\nContraindication\nPulmoCare-L inhaler is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to \nlevosalbutamol, racemic salbutamol, or any \nother component of PulmoCare-L inhaler. \nReactions have included urticaria, angioedema, \nrash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and \noropharyngeal edema.\nWarning and Precaution\nParadoxical Bronchospasm: PulmoCare-L can \nproduce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may \nbe life-threatening. If paradoxical \nbronchospasm occurs, PulmoCare-L should \nbe discontinued immediately and alternative \ntherapy instituted. It should be recognized that \nparadoxical bronchospasm, when associated \nwith inhaled formulations, frequently occurs \nwith the ﬁrst use of a new canister. \nDeterioration of Asthma: Asthma may \ndeteriorate acutely over a period of hours or \nchronically over several days or longer. If the \npatient needs more doses of PulmoCare-L \nthan usual, this may be a marker of \ndestabilization of asthma and requires \nreevaluation of the patient and treatment \nregimen, giving special consideration to the \npossible need for anti-inﬂammatory treatment, \ne.g., corticosteroids. Use of Anti-Inﬂammatory \nAgents: The use of a beta-adrenergic agonist \nalone may not be adequate to control asthma in many patients. Early consideration should be \ngiven to adding anti-inﬂammatory agents, e.g., \ncorticosteroids, to the therapeutic regimen. \nCardiovascular Effects: PulmoCare-L, like \nother beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce \nclinically signiﬁcant cardiovascular effects in \nsome patients, as measured by heart rate, \nblood pressure, and symptoms. Although such \neffects are uncommon after administration of \nPulmoCare-L at recommended doses, if they \noccur, the drug may need to be discontinued. \nIn addition, beta agonists have been reported \nto produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, \nsuch as ﬂattening of the T wave, prolongation \nof the QTC interval, and ST segment \ndepression. The clinical signiﬁcance of these \nﬁndings is unknown. Therefore, PulmoCare-L, \nlike all sympathomimetic amines, should be \nused with caution in patients with \ncardiovascular disorders, especially coronary \ninsufﬁciency, cardiac arrhythmias, and \nhypertension. Coexisting Conditions: \nPulmoCare-L, like all sympathomimetic \namines, should be used with caution in patients \nwith Cardiovascular disorders, especially \ncoronary insufﬁciency, hypertension, and \ncardiac arrhythmias; in patients with convulsive \ndisorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus; and in patients who are unusually responsive to \nsympathomimetic amines. Clinically signiﬁcant \nchanges in systolic and diastolic blood pressure \nhave been seen in individual patients and could \nbe expected to occur in some patients after the \nuse of any beta-adrenergic bronchodilator. \nLarge doses of intravenous racemic albuterol \nhave been reported to aggravate preexisting \ndiabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. \nHypokalemia: As with other beta-adrenergic \nagonist medications, PulmoCare-L may \nproduce signiﬁcant hypokalemia in some \npatients, possibly through intracellular \nshunting, which has the potential to produce \nadverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease is \nusually transient, not requiring \nsupplementation.\nSide Effects \nPulmoCare-L can cause serious side effects \nincluding sudden shortness of breath \n(bronchospasm), worsening asthma, heart \nproblems, serious allergic reactions (swelling of \nthe face, throat or tongue, hives, rash, \nbreathing problems), low potassium levels in \nyour blood. The most common side effects \ninclude accidental injury, bronchitis, dizziness, \npain, sore throat, runny nose, vomiting, \npalpitations, chest pain, fast heart rate, tremors, nervousness.\nPregnancy and Lactations\nPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate \nand well-controlled studies of PulmoCare-L in \npregnant women. Because animal reproduction \nstudies are not always predictive of human \nresponse, PulmoCare-L should be used during \npregnancy only if the potential beneﬁt justiﬁes \nthe potential risk to the fetus. Plasma \nconcentrations of Levosalbutamol after \ninhalation of therapeutic doses are very low in \nhumans. It is not known whether \nLevosalbutamol is excreted in human milk.\nBecause of the potential for tumorigenicity \nshown for racemic salbutamol in animal studies \nand the lack of experience with the use of \nPulmoCare-L by nursing mothers, a decision \nshould be made whether to discontinue \nnursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into \naccount the importance of the drug to the \nmother. Caution should be exercised when \nPulmoCare-L is administered to a nursing \nwoman.\nDrug interaction\nOther short-acting sympathomimetic aerosol \nbronchodilators or epinephrine should not be \nused concomitantly with PulmoCare-L. If additional adrenergic drugs are to be \nadministered by any route, they should be used \nwith caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular \neffects. \nBeta-blockers: Beta-adrenergic receptor \nblocking agents not only block the pulmonary \neffect of beta-adrenergic agonists, such as \nPulmoCare-L, but may produce severe \nbronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, \npatients with asthma should not normally be \ntreated with betablockers. However, under \ncertain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after \nmyocardial infarction, there may be no \nacceptable alternatives to the use of \nbeta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients \nwith asthma. In this setting, cardioselective \nbeta-blockers should be considered, although \nthey should be administered with caution.\nDiuretics: The ECG changes or hypokalemia \nthat may result from the administration of \nnon-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop \nand thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened \nby beta-agonists, especially when the \nrecommended dose of the beta-agonist is \nexceeded. Although the clinical signiﬁcance of \nthese effects is not known, caution is advised in \nthe coadministration of beta agonists with non-potassium-sparing diuretics. Consider \nmonitoring potassium levels.\nDigoxin: Mean decreases of 16 to 22 in \nserum digoxin levels were demonstrated after \nsingle-dose intravenous and oral administration \nof racemic salbutamol, respectively, to normal \nvolunteers who had received digoxin for 10 \ndays. The clinical signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings \nfor patients with obstructive airway disease \nwho are receiving PulmoCare-L and digoxin \non a chronic basis is unclear. Nevertheless, it \nwould be prudent to carefully evaluate the \nserum digoxin levels in patients who are \ncurrently receiving digoxin and PulmoCare-L.\nMonamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic \nAntidepressants: PulmoCare-L should be \nadministered with extreme caution to patients \nbeing treated with monoamine oxidase \ninhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within \n2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, \nbecause the action of albuterol on the vascular \nsystem may be potentiated. Consider \nalternative therapy in patients taking MAO \ninhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants.\nOverdosage\nThe expected symptoms with overdosage are those of excessive beta-adrenergic receptor \nstimulation andor occurrence or exaggeration \nof any of the symptoms listed under ADVERSE \nREACTIONS, e.g., seizures, angina, \nhypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with \nrates up to 200 beatsminute, arrhythmias, \nnervousness, headache, tremor, dry mouth, \npalpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, \nand sleeplessness. Hypokalemia also may \noccur. As with all sympathomimetic \nmedications, cardiac arrest and even death may \nbe associated with the abuse of PulmoCare-L. \nTreatment consists of discontinuation of \nPulmoCare-L together with appropriate \nsymptomatic therapy. The judicious use of a \ncardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be \nconsidered, bearing in mind that such \nmedication can produce bronchospasm. There \nis insufﬁcient evidence to determine if dialysis \nis beneﬁcial for overdosage of PulmoCare-L. \nPharmaceutical Precaution\nPressurized canister, do not puncture, break or \nincinerate even when apparently empty. Avoid \nstorage in direct sunlight or heat. Store below \n30 ºC. Keep away from eyes.

      "dosage": "Dosage and Administration\nFor treatment of acute episodes of \nbronchospasm or prevention of asthmatic \nsymptoms, the usual dosage of PulmoCare-L \nfor adults and children 4 years of age and older \nis 2 inhalations (100 mcg) repeated every 4 to 6 \nhours; in some patients, 1 inhalation every 4 \nhours may be sufﬁcient. \nMore frequent administration or a larger \nnumber of inhalations is not routinely \nrecommended. If a previously effective dosage \nregimen fails to provide the usual response, this \nmay be a marker of destabilization of asthma \nand requires re-evaluation of the patient and \nthe treatment regimen, giving special \nconsideration to the possible need for \nanti-inﬂammatory treatment, e.g., \ncorticosteroids.\nContraindication\nPulmoCare-L inhaler is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to \nlevosalbutamol, racemic salbutamol, or any \nother component of PulmoCare-L inhaler. \nReactions have included urticaria, angioedema, \nrash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and \noropharyngeal edema.\nWarning and Precaution\nParadoxical Bronchospasm: PulmoCare-L can \nproduce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may \nbe life-threatening. If paradoxical \nbronchospasm occurs, PulmoCare-L should \nbe discontinued immediately and alternative \ntherapy instituted. It should be recognized that \nparadoxical bronchospasm, when associated \nwith inhaled formulations, frequently occurs \nwith the ﬁrst use of a new canister. \nDeterioration of Asthma: Asthma may \ndeteriorate acutely over a period of hours or \nchronically over several days or longer. If the \npatient needs more doses of PulmoCare-L \nthan usual, this may be a marker of \ndestabilization of asthma and requires \nreevaluation of the patient and treatment \nregimen, giving special consideration to the \npossible need for anti-inﬂammatory treatment, \ne.g., corticosteroids. Use of Anti-Inﬂammatory \nAgents: The use of a beta-adrenergic agonist \nalone may not be adequate to control asthma in many patients. Early consideration should be \ngiven to adding anti-inﬂammatory agents, e.g., \ncorticosteroids, to the therapeutic regimen. \nCardiovascular Effects: PulmoCare-L, like \nother beta-adrenergic agonists, can produce \nclinically signiﬁcant cardiovascular effects in \nsome patients, as measured by heart rate, \nblood pressure, and symptoms. Although such \neffects are uncommon after administration of \nPulmoCare-L at recommended doses, if they \noccur, the drug may need to be discontinued. \nIn addition, beta agonists have been reported \nto produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, \nsuch as ﬂattening of the T wave, prolongation \nof the QTC interval, and ST segment \ndepression. The clinical signiﬁcance of these \nﬁndings is unknown. Therefore, PulmoCare-L, \nlike all sympathomimetic amines, should be \nused with caution in patients with \ncardiovascular disorders, especially coronary \ninsufﬁciency, cardiac arrhythmias, and \nhypertension. Coexisting Conditions: \nPulmoCare-L, like all sympathomimetic \namines, should be used with caution in patients \nwith Cardiovascular disorders, especially \ncoronary insufﬁciency, hypertension, and \ncardiac arrhythmias; in patients with convulsive \ndisorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus; and in patients who are unusually responsive to \nsympathomimetic amines. Clinically signiﬁcant \nchanges in systolic and diastolic blood pressure \nhave been seen in individual patients and could \nbe expected to occur in some patients after the \nuse of any beta-adrenergic bronchodilator. \nLarge doses of intravenous racemic albuterol \nhave been reported to aggravate preexisting \ndiabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. \nHypokalemia: As with other beta-adrenergic \nagonist medications, PulmoCare-L may \nproduce signiﬁcant hypokalemia in some \npatients, possibly through intracellular \nshunting, which has the potential to produce \nadverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease is \nusually transient, not requiring \nsupplementation.\nSide Effects \nPulmoCare-L can cause serious side effects \nincluding sudden shortness of breath \n(bronchospasm), worsening asthma, heart \nproblems, serious allergic reactions (swelling of \nthe face, throat or tongue, hives, rash, \nbreathing problems), low potassium levels in \nyour blood. The most common side effects \ninclude accidental injury, bronchitis, dizziness, \npain, sore throat, runny nose, vomiting, \npalpitations, chest pain, fast heart rate, tremors, nervousness.\nPregnancy and Lactations\nPregnancy Category C. There are no adequate \nand well-controlled studies of PulmoCare-L in \npregnant women. Because animal reproduction \nstudies are not always predictive of human \nresponse, PulmoCare-L should be used during \npregnancy only if the potential beneﬁt justiﬁes \nthe potential risk to the fetus. Plasma \nconcentrations of Levosalbutamol after \ninhalation of therapeutic doses are very low in \nhumans. It is not known whether \nLevosalbutamol is excreted in human milk.\nBecause of the potential for tumorigenicity \nshown for racemic salbutamol in animal studies \nand the lack of experience with the use of \nPulmoCare-L by nursing mothers, a decision \nshould be made whether to discontinue \nnursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into \naccount the importance of the drug to the \nmother. Caution should be exercised when \nPulmoCare-L is administered to a nursing \nwoman.\nDrug interaction\nOther short-acting sympathomimetic aerosol \nbronchodilators or epinephrine should not be \nused concomitantly with PulmoCare-L. If additional adrenergic drugs are to be \nadministered by any route, they should be used \nwith caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular \neffects. \nBeta-blockers: Beta-adrenergic receptor \nblocking agents not only block the pulmonary \neffect of beta-adrenergic agonists, such as \nPulmoCare-L, but may produce severe \nbronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, \npatients with asthma should not normally be \ntreated with betablockers. However, under \ncertain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after \nmyocardial infarction, there may be no \nacceptable alternatives to the use of \nbeta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients \nwith asthma. In this setting, cardioselective \nbeta-blockers should be considered, although \nthey should be administered with caution.\nDiuretics: The ECG changes or hypokalemia \nthat may result from the administration of \nnon-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop \nand thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened \nby beta-agonists, especially when the \nrecommended dose of the beta-agonist is \nexceeded. Although the clinical signiﬁcance of \nthese effects is not known, caution is advised in \nthe coadministration of beta agonists with non-potassium-sparing diuretics. Consider \nmonitoring potassium levels.\nDigoxin: Mean decreases of 16 to 22 in \nserum digoxin levels were demonstrated after \nsingle-dose intravenous and oral administration \nof racemic salbutamol, respectively, to normal \nvolunteers who had received digoxin for 10 \ndays. The clinical signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings \nfor patients with obstructive airway disease \nwho are receiving PulmoCare-L and digoxin \non a chronic basis is unclear. Nevertheless, it \nwould be prudent to carefully evaluate the \nserum digoxin levels in patients who are \ncurrently receiving digoxin and PulmoCare-L.\nMonamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic \nAntidepressants: PulmoCare-L should be \nadministered with extreme caution to patients \nbeing treated with monoamine oxidase \ninhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within \n2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, \nbecause the action of albuterol on the vascular \nsystem may be potentiated. Consider \nalternative therapy in patients taking MAO \ninhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants.\nOverdosage\nThe expected symptoms with overdosage are those of excessive beta-adrenergic receptor \nstimulation andor occurrence or exaggeration \nof any of the symptoms listed under ADVERSE \nREACTIONS, e.g., seizures, angina, \nhypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with \nrates up to 200 beatsminute, arrhythmias, \nnervousness, headache, tremor, dry mouth, \npalpitation, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, \nand sleeplessness. Hypokalemia also may \noccur. As with all sympathomimetic \nmedications, cardiac arrest and even death may \nbe associated with the abuse of PulmoCare-L. \nTreatment consists of discontinuation of \nPulmoCare-L together with appropriate \nsymptomatic therapy. The judicious use of a \ncardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be \nconsidered, bearing in mind that such \nmedication can produce bronchospasm. There \nis insufﬁcient evidence to determine if dialysis \nis beneﬁcial for overdosage of PulmoCare-L. \nPharmaceutical Precaution\nPressurized canister, do not puncture, break or \nincinerate even when apparently empty.

      "description": "Description\nPulmocare\n is a synthetic sympathomimetic amine, \ncommercially available as its sulphate salt. It is beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist which stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors. It is believed that beta-adrenergic agonists stimulate the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) which appears to mediate numerous cellular responses. Pulmocare\n appears to act on uterine and vascular \nsmooth muscles (beta-2 receptors) than on beta-adrenergic receptors of the heart (beta-1 receptors). The main effect following oral administration of Salbutamol is bronchodilation resulting from relaxation of smooth muscles of the bronchial tree.\nResults of animal studies indicate that Salbutamol does \nnot cross the blood brain- barrier, but the drug \napparently crosses the placenta. Salbutamol is \nextensively metabolized in the liver mainly to \nSalbutamol 4-o-sulphate which has little or no beta-adrenergic blocking effect. Salbutamol and its metabolites are rapidly excreted in urine and feces.\nIndication\nPulmocare\n is indicated for the relief of bronchospasm \nin patients with reversible obstructive airway diseases like Bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis, Emphysema, etc. Because of the sustained release formulation\nDosage And Administration\nAdults: The recommended usual oral dose is 2-4 mg tablet 3-4 times daily or as prescribed by physicians. Children (2-6 years of age): 1-2 mg three to four times \ndaily or as prescribed by the physician. \nNot recommended under the age of 2 years.Elderly: Usually dose adjustment is not required in the elderly.\nContraindication And Precaution\nSalbutamol is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of their components. Salbutamol should be used with caution in patients \nwith hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, occlusive \nvascular disorders, hypertension and aneurysms. Hypokalaemia associated with high doses of Salbutamol may result in increased susceptibility to digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmia.\nSide Effect\nThe adverse reactions to Salbutamol are similar in \nnature to reactions to other sympathomimetic agents. The most frequent adverse reactions to Salbutamol are \nnervousness, tremor, headache, tachycardia, and palpitation. Less frequent adverse reactions are muscle cramps, insomnia, nausea, weakness, dizziness, drowsiness, flushing, restlessness, irritability, chest discomfort and difficulty in micturation. Hypersensitivity reactions including paradoxical broncospasm are rare.\nDrug Interaction\nThe concomitant use of Pulmocare\n tablets and other \noral sympathomimetic agents are not recommended since such combined use may lead to deleterious cardiovascular effects. Salbutamol should be administered with extreme caution to patients being \ntreated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic \nantidepressants because the action of Salbutamol on \nthe vascular system may be potentiated. Beta-receptor blocking agents and Salbutamol inhibit the effect of \neach other.\nUse In Pregnancy And Lactation\nAdministration of drugs during pregnancy should only be considered if expected benefit to the mother is greater than any possible risk to the fetus. As Salbutamol is probably secreted in breast milk, its use in nursing mothers is not recommended unless the expected benefits out-weigh any potential risk.\nOver dosage\nThe symptoms with over dosage are angina, headache, nausea, vomiting, tremor etc. The preference antidote for over dosage with Salbutamol is cardio-selective beta-blocking agent but beta-blocking drugs should be used with caution in patients with a history of \nbronchospasm\nCommercial pack\nPulmocare\n 4 mg tablet: Box containing 10 x 10 tablets \nin strip pack.\nStorage\nStore in a cool and dry place below 30 ºC.

      "composition": "Composition \nQuinoflox tablets: Each tablet contains Sparfloxacin INN 200 mg.\nQuinoflox is available as a 200 mg capsule shape, film-coated tablet.\nProperties and effects\nQuinoflox is a preparation of Sparfloxacin ( spar-FLOX-a-sin). It is a broad-\nspectrum antibacterial agent that inhibit DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV and \nkills many of the types of bacteria that can infect the breathing airways and lungs \nand has been shown in a large number of clinical trials to be safe and effective \nfor the treatment of bacterial infections. It is found to be more effective in vitro \nthan other fluoroquinolones against some gram positive organisms \n(Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureous,), Mycobacteria and \nChlamydia spp. \nPharmacokinetics\nAbsorption: Quinoflox is well absorbed following oral administration with an \nabsolute oral bioavailability of 92. The mean maximum plasma sparfloxacin \nconcentration following a single 400-mg oral dose was approximately 1.3 (0.2) \nµgmL. The area under the curve (mean AUC 0   ) following a single 400-mg \noral dose was approximately 34 (6.8) µghrmL. Steady-state plasma \nconcentration was achieved on the first day by giving a loading dose that was \ndouble the daily dose. \nMaximum plasma concentrations for a 200 mg dose were also achieved between \n3 to 6 hours after administration with a mean of about 4 hours.\n \nOral absorption of sparfloxacin is unaffected by administration with milk or food, \nincluding high fat meals. Concurrent administration of antacids containing \nmagnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide reduces the oral bioavailability \nof sparfloxacin by as much as 50. \n \nDistribution: Upon reaching general circulation, Quinoflox distributes well into \nthe body, as reflected by the large mean steady-state volume of distribution \n(Vdss ) of 3.9 (0.8) Lkg. Sparfloxacin exhibits low plasma protein binding in \nserum at about 45. Sparfloxacin penetrates well into body fluids and tissues. \nResults of tissue and body fluid distribution studies demonstrated that oral \nadministration of sparfloxacin produces sustained concentrations and that \nsparfloxacin concentrations in lower respiratory tract tissues and fluids generally \nexceed the corresponding plasma concentrations. \nThe concentration of sparfloxacin in respiratory tissues (pulmonary parenchyma, \nbronchial wall, and bronchial mucosa) at 2 to 6 hours following standard oral \ndosing was approximately 3 to 6 times greater than the corresponding \nconcentration in plasma. Concentrations in these respiratory tissues increase at \nup to 24 hours following dosing. Sparfloxacin is also highly concentrated into \nalveolar macrophages compared to plasma. \nMean pleural effusion to plasma concentration ratios were 0.34 and 0.69 at 4 and \n20 hours postdose, respectively. \nMetabolism: Quinoflox is metabolised by the liver, primarily by phase II \nglucuronidation, to form a glucuronide conjugate. Its metabolism does not utilize \nor interfere with cytochrome-mediated oxidation, in particular cytochrome P450. \nExcretion: The total body clearance and renal clearance of Quinoflox were 11.4 \n(3.5) and 1.5 (0.5) Lhr, respectively. Sparfloxacin is excreted in both the feces \n(50) and urine (50). Approximately 10 of an orally administered dose is \nexcreted in the urine as unchanged drug in patients with normal renal function. \nSpecial Populations \nGeriatric: The pharmacokinetics of sparfloxacin are not altered in the elderly with \nnormal renal function. \nPaediatric: The pharmacokinetics of sparfloxacin in paediatric subjects have not \nbeen studied. \nGender: There are no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of sparfloxacin. \nRenal insufficiency: In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance  18 years of \nage) with the following infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated \nmicroorganisms: \nCommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae, \nHaemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, \nMycoplasma pneumoniae , or Streptococcus pneumoniae \nAcute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB) caused by \nChlamydia pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, \nHaemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, \nStaphylococcus aureus , or Streptococcus pneumoniae. \nIt is also indicated for\n Chronic Obstructive P ulmonary Disease (C OPD)\n Acute Maxillary Sinusitis (A MS)\n Urinary tract infections including gonococc al and nongonococc al urethritis, \nchancroid and other sexually transmitted disease s.\n Bacterial prost atitis Bacterial diarrhoea\n Osteomyelitis\n Other use s include treatment of tuberculosis in combination with rifampicin \nand isoniazid, treatment of leprosy in combination with st andard drugs.\nDosage and Administration \n \nThe recommended daily dose of Quinoflox in patients with normal renal function \nis two 200 mg tablets taken on the first day as a loading dose. Thereafter, one \n200 mg tablet should be taken every 24 hours for a total of 10 days of therapy (11 \ntablets). \nThe recommended daily dose of Quinoflox in patients with renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance 50 mLmin) is two 200 mg tablets taken on the first day \nas a loading dose. Thereafter, one 200-mg tablet should be taken every 48 hours \nfor a total of 9 days of therapy (6 tablets). \nContraindications\n Sparfloxacin is contraindicated to the patients who are hypersensitive to any of \nits ingredient\n Pregnancy and lactation\n Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency\n History of Achilles tendinitis following the use of fluoroquinolones\nSpecial warnings\nModerate to severe phototoxic reactions have occurred in patients exposed to \ndirect or indirect sunlight or to artificial ultraviolet light (e.g., sunlamps) during or \nfollowing treatment. Patients should be advised to discontinue Sparfloxacin \ntherapy at the first signs or symptoms of a phototoxicity reaction such as: \n Sensation of skin burning\n Swelling\n Rash\n Itching\n Dermatitis\nIncreases in the QTc interval. \nThe safety and effectiveness of Sparfloxacin in children, adolescents (under the \nage of 18 years), pregnant women, and lactating women have not been \nestablished.  \nPrecaution:\n Adequate hydration of patients receiving Sparfloxacin should be maintained to \nprevent the formation of a highly concentrated urine.\n Administer Sparfloxacin with caution in the presence of renal insufficiency. \n Avoid the concomitant prescription of medications known to prolong the QTc \ninterval, e.g., erythromycin, terfenadine etc.\n Excessive exposure to sunlight should be avoided.\nDrug Interaction\nAluminium and Magnesium cations in antacids and sucralfate form chelation \ncomplexes with sparfloxacin.

Quetiapine exhibits a higher affinity for serotonin (5HT2) receptors in the brain than it does \nfor dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the brain. Quetiapine also has \nhigh affinity at histaminergic and adrenergic-1 receptors, with a \nlower affinity at adrenergic-2 receptors, but no appreciable affinity at cholinergic muscarinic or benzodiazepine receptors. Quetiapine is active in tests for antipsychotic activity, such as conditioned avoidance.",

      "composition": "Not Found",
      "indications": "Indications \nRansys  AM is indicated for the treatment of \nhypertension, alone or with other antihypertensive \nagents, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood \npressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal \ncardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial \ninfarctions. These benefits have been seen in \ncontrolled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide \nvariety of pharmacologic classes including the class to \nwhich this drug principally belongs. There are no \ncontrolled trials demonstrating risk reduction with \nRansys AM.\nRansys AM may  also  be  used  as  initial  therapy  in  \npatients  who  are  likely  to  need multiple \nantihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure \ngoals.",
      "dosage": "Dosage and administration\nGeneral considerations:\nMaximum antihypertensive effects are attained within 2 \nweeks.  Ransys AM may be taken with or without \nfood.  Ransys AM may be administered with other \nantihypertensive agents.  Dosage may be increased \nafter 2 weeks.  The maximum recommended dose of \nRansys AM is 2 tablets (4010 mg) once daily. \nInitial therapy:\nThe usual starting dose of Ransys AM is one tablet \n(205 mg) once daily. Depending on the  blood  \npressure  response,  the  dose  may  be  titrated  at  \nintervals  of  1 -2  weeks  to two tablets of Ransys AM \n(4010 mg) once daily.\nReplacement therapy:\nRansys AM may be substituted for its individually \ntitrated components. When substituting  for  individual  \ncomponents,  the  dose  of  one  or  both  of  the  \ncomponents can be increased if blood pressure control \nhas not been satisfactory.\nAdd-on Therapy:\nRansys AM may be used to provide additional blood \npressure lowering for patients not adequately  \ncontrolled  with  Amlodipine  (or  another \ndihydropyridine  calcium  channel blocker)  alone  or  \nwith  Olmesartan  Medoxomil  (or  another  \nAngiotensin  Receptor Blocker) alone.\nElderly patients:\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients \n 65 years age. Patients with hepatic impairment:\nInitial therapy with  Ransys AM is  not  recommended  \nin  patients  75  years and in patients with hepatic \nimpairment. \nChildren:\nThe safety and effectiveness of Ransys AM in  \npediatric  patients  have  not  been established.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation: \nPregnancy Category D.\nIt is not known whether Amlodipine or Olmesartan  \nMedoxomil is  excreted  in human milk.\nSide effects\nThe  overall  incidence  of  side  effects  on  therapy  with  \nOlmesartan and Amlodipine combination  was  similar  \nto  that  seen  with  corresponding  doses  of  the  \nindividual components  and  to  placebo.  The  common  \nside  effects  include  edema,  hypotension, orthostatic \nhypotension, rash, pruritus, palpitation, urinary \nfrequency, and nocturia. Long term use of Olmesartan \nMedoxomil can cause sprue-like-enteropathy.",

Hydrochlorothiazide is a Thiazide Diuretic that affects \nthe renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte \nreabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium \nand chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. \nIndirectly, the diuretic action of Hydrochlorothiazide \nreduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium.

Ransys Plus may also be used as initial \ntherapy in patients who are likely to need multiple \nantihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals.\nDosage and administration\nDosage must be individualized. Ransys Plus can be taken with or without food.\nAdults:\nThe usual recommended starting dose is one tablet of Ransys Plus (2012.5) once daily. Depending on the blood pressure response, the dose may be titrated at intervals of 2-4 weeks to two tablets of Ransys Plus \n(4025) once daily.\nElderly and renal impairment:\nIn elderly patients the same dosage of the combination is recommended as for adults. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal \nimpairment (Creatinine clearance is  30 mlmin,  60 \nmlmin). In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so Ransys Plus is not recommended. Children and adolescents Ransys Plus is not recommended for use i n children below 18 \nyears due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment:\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary with hepatic impairment.\nUse in pregnancy and lactation \nPregnancy:Pregnancy Categories C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimesters). This combination drug should not \nbe used during pregnancy.\nNursing Mothers:\nIt  is  not  known  whether  Olmesartan  is  excreted in  human  milk,  but  Olmesartan  is  secreted  at low concentration in the milk of lactating rats. Thiazides \nappear in human milk. Because of the potential  for  \nadverse  effects  on  the  nursing  infant,  a  decision  should  be  made  whether  to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\nUse in children:\nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.\nSide-effects\nThis  combination  tablet  has  been  evaluated  for  safety  in  1,243  hypertensive  patients.  It  was well  tolerated,  with  an  incidence  of  adverse  events  similar  to  placebo.  Events  generally  were mild,  transient  and  had  no  relationship  to  the  dose  of  this  combination  tablet.  Some  common side effects \ninclude:  headache, urinary tract infection, chest pain, \nback pain, peripheral edema, vertigo, abdominal pain, \ndyspepsia, gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, SGOT (Serum \nGlutamic-Oxaloacetic Transaminase) increased, GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase) increased, SGPT \n(Serum Glutamic-Pyruvic Transaminase)  increased,  \ncreatine  phosphokinase  increased,  hyperglycemia,  \narthritis, arthralgia, myalgia, coughing, rash etc. Long \nterm use of Olmesartan Medoxomil can cause \nsprue-like-enteropathy.",

      "description": "DescriptionThe Rituximab antibody is a genetically engineered chimeric murinehuman monoclonal antibody. It is directed against the CD20 antigen which found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. The antibody is an IgG kappa immunoglobulin containing murine light- and heavy chain variable region sequences and human constant region sequences. Rituximab is composed of two heavy chains of 451 amino acids and two light chains of 213 amino acids (based on cDNA analysis) and has an approximate molecular weight of 145 kD. Rituximab has a binding affinity for the CD20 antigen approximately 8.0 nM. Rituximab is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative-free liquid concentrate for intravenous (IV) administration.\nClinical pharmacology\nGeneralRituximab binds specifically to the antigen CD20 (human B-lymphocyte-restricted differentiation antigen, Bp35), a hydrophobic transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of approximately35 kD located on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. The antigen is also expressed on  90 of Bcell non-Hodgkin is lymphomas (NHL), but is not found on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B cells, normal plasma cells or other normal tissues. CD20 regulates an early step(s) in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize upon antibody binding.Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation.\nPreclinical Pharmacology and Toxicology\nMechanism of Action: The Fab domain of Rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis in-vitro. Possible mechanisms of cell lysis include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody has been shown to induce apoptosis in the DHL-4 human B-cell lymphoma line.\nNormal Tissue Cross-reactivity:  Rituximab binding was observed on \nlymphoid cells in the thymus, the white pulp of the spleen, and a majority of \nB lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymph nodes. Little or no binding was observed in the non-lymphoid tissues examined.Pharmacokinetics:In patients given single doses at 10, 50, 100, 250 or 500 mgm\n2 as an IV \ninfusion, serum levels and the half-life of Rituximab were proportional to dose. In 14 patients given 375 mgm\n2 as an IV infusion for 4 weekly doses, \nthe mean serum half-life was 76.3 hours (range, 31.5 to 152.6 hours) after the first infusion and 205.8 hours (range, 83.9 to 407 .0 hours); after the fourth infusion. The wide range of half-lives may reflect the variable tumor burden among patients and the changes in CD20-positive (normal and malignant) B-cell populations upon repeated administrations.Rituximab at a dose of 375 mgm\n2 was administered as an IV infusion at \nweekly intervals for 4 doses to 203 patients naive to Rituximab. The mean Cmax following the fourth infusion was 486 µgmL (range, 77 .5 to 996.6 µgmL). The peak and trough serum levels of Rituximab were inversely correlated with baseline values for the number of circulating CD20 positive B cells and measures of disease burden. Median steady-state serum levels were higher for responders compared with non-responders; however, no difference was found in the rate of elimination as measured by serum half-life. Serum levels were higher in patients with International Working Formulation (IWF) subtypes B, C, and D as compared with those with subtype A. Rituximab was detectable in the serum of patients 3 to 6 months after completion of treatment. Rituximab at a dose of 375 mgm\n2 was \nadministered as an IV infusion at weekly intervals for 8 doses to 37 patients. The mean Cmax after 8 infusions was 550 µgmL (range, 171 to 1177 µgmL). The mean Cmax increased with each successive infusion through the eighth infusion. The pharmacokinetic profile of Rituximab when administered as 6 infusions of 375 mgm\n2 in combination with 6 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy \nwas similar to that seen with Rituximab alone. Administration of Rituximab resulted in a rapid and sustained depletion of circulating and tissue-based B \ncells.\nLymph node biopsies performed 14 days after therapy showed a decrease in the percentage of B cells in seven of eight patients who had received single doses of Rituximab 100 mgm\n2. Among the 166 patients in the pivotal \nstudy, circulating B cells (measured as CD19-positive cells) were depleted within the first three doses with sustained depletion for up to 6 to 9 months post treatment in 83 of patients. Of the responding patients assessed (n  80), 1 failed to show significant depletion of CD19-positive cells after the third infusion of Rituximab as compared to19 of the non-responding patients. B-cell recovery began at approximately 6 months following completion of treatment. Median B-cell levels returned to normal by 12 months following completion of treatment. There were sustained and statistically significant reductions in both IgM and IgG serum levels observed from 5 through 11 months following Rituximab administration.However, only 14 of patients had reductions in IgM andor IgG serum levels, resulting in values below the normal range.",

Methylprednisolone 100 mg intravenous or its equivalent glucocorticoid is recommended 30 minutes prior to each infusionWegeners Granulomatosis (WG) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA)Administer Recelbia\n as a 375 mgm2 intravenous infusion once weekly for 4 \nweeks.\nInstructions for Administration\nPreparation for Administration:  Withdraw the necessary amount of \nRecelbia and dilute to a final concentration of 1 to 4 mgmL into an infusion \nbag containing either 0.9 Sodium Chloride, USP, or 5 Dextrose in Water, USP. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. Discard any unused portion left in the vial. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Recelbia\n \nsolutions for infusion may be stored at2-8oC (36-4 6oF) for 24 hours. Recelbia solutions for infusion have been \nshown to be stable for an additional 24 hours at room temperature. However, since Recelbia\n solutions do not contain a preservative, diluted solutions \nshould be stored refrigerated (2oC-8oC). No incompatibilities between \nRecelbia and polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags have been observed.\nDo not administer as an intravenous push or bolusInfusion and hypersensitivity reactions may occur. Premedication consisting of acetaminophen and diphenhydramine should be considered before each infusion of Rituximab. Premedication may attenuate infusion reactions. Since transient hypotension may occur during Rituximab infusion, consideration should be given to withholding antihypertensive medications 12 hours prior to Rituximab infusion.First Infusion: The Recelbia\n solution for infusion should be administered \nintravenously at an initial rate of 50 mghr. Recelbia should not be mixed or \ndiluted with other drugs. If hypersensitivity or infusion reactions do not occur, escalate the infusion rate in 50 mghr increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mghr. If a hypersensitivity (non-IgEmediated) or an infusion reaction develops, the infusion should be temporarily slowed or interrupted. The infusion can continue at one-half the previous rate upon improvement of patient symptoms.Subsequent Infusions: If the patient tolerated the first infusion well, subsequent Recelbia\n infusions can be administered at an initial rate of 100 \nmghr, and increased by 100 mghr increments at 30-minute intervals, to a maximum of 400 mghr as tolerated. If the patient did not tolerate the first infusion well, follow the guidelines under First Infusion.",

      "contraindications": "Contraindications\nRecelbia\n is contraindicated in patients with known anaphylaxis or \nIgE-mediated hypersensitivity to murine proteins or to any component of this product.\nWarnings\nSevere infusion reactions:  Rituximab has common severe infusion \nreactions. In some cases, these reactions were fatal. These severe reactions typically occurred during the first infusion with time to onset of 30 to 120 minutes. Signs and symptoms of severe infusion reactions may include hypotension, angioedema, hypoxia or bronchospasm, and may require interruption of Rituximab administration. The most severe manifestations and sequelae include pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiogenic shock. In the reported cases, the following factors were more frequently associated with fatal outcomes: female gender, pulmonary infiltrates, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia or mantle cell lymphoma.Management of severe infusion reactions: The Rituximab infusion should be interrupted for severe reactions and supportive care measures instituted as medically indicated (e.g., intravenous fluids, vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, and acetaminophen). In most cases, the infusion can be resumed at a 50 reduction in rate (e.g., from 100 mghr to \n13001359For further information, please contact: 01977 157 108\n(9.00 am - 5.00 pm)50 mghr) after symptoms have completely resolved. Patients requiring close \nmonitoring during first and all subsequent infusions include those with pre-existing cardiac and pulmonary conditions, those with prior clinically significant cardiopulmonary adverse events and those with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (25,000mm\n3) with or without evidence of high \ntumor burden.Rapid reduction in tumor volume followed by acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, or hyperphosphatasemia, have been reported within 12 to 24 hours after the first Rituximab infusion. Rare instances of fatal outcome have been reported in the setting of TLS following treatment with Rituximab. The risks of TLS appear to be greater in patients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (25,000mm\n3) or high \ntumor burden. Prophylaxis for TLS should be considered for patients at high risk. Correction of electrolyte abnormalities, monitoring of renal function and fluid balance, and administration of supportive care, including dialysis should be initiated as indicated. Following complete resolution of the complications of TLS, Rituximab has been tolerated when re-administered in conjunction with prophylactic therapy for TLS in a limited number of cases.Hypersensitivity Reactions:Rituximab has been associated with hypersensitivity reactions (non-IgE-mediated reactions) which may respond to adjustments in the infusion rate and in medical management.Hypotension, bronchospasm, and angioedema have occurred in association with Rituximab infusion. Rituximab infusion should be interrupted for severe hypersensitivity reactions and can be resumed at a 50 reduction in rate (e.g., from 100 mghr to 50 mghr) when symptoms have completely resolved. Treatment of these symptoms with diphenhydramine and acetaminophen is recommended; additional treatment with bronchodilators or IV saline may be indicated. In most cases, patients who have experienced non-life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions have been able to complete the full course of therapy. Medications for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, e.g., epinephrine, antihistamines and corticosteroids, should be available for immediate use in the event of a reaction during administration.Cardiovascular:Infusions should be discontinued in the event of serious or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Patients who develop clinically significant arrhythmias should undergo cardiac monitoring during and after subsequent infusions of Rituximab. Patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions including arrhythmias and angina have had recurrences of these events during Rituximab therapy and should be monitored throughout the infusion and immediate post-infusion period.Renal:Rituximab administration has been associated with severe renal toxicity including acute renal failure requiring dialysis and in some cases, has led to a fatal outcome. Renal toxicity has occurred in patients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells ( 25,000mm\n3) or high tumor burden who \nexperience tumor lysis syndrome and in patients administered concomitant cisplatin therapy during clinical trials. The combination of cisplatin and Rituximab is not an approved treatment regimen. If this combination is used in clinical trials extreme caution should be exercised; patients should be monitored closely for signs of renal failure. Discontinuation ofRituximab should be considered for those with rising serum creatinine or oliguria.Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions:Mucocutaneous reactions, some with fatal outcome, have been reported in patients treated with Rituximab. These reports include paraneoplastic pemphigus (an uncommon disorder which is a manifestation of the patients underlying malignancy), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The onset of the reaction in the reported cases has varied from 1 to 13 weeks following Rituximab exposure. Patients experiencing a severe mucocutaneous reaction should not receive any further infusions and seek prompt medical evaluation. Skin biopsy may help to distinguish among different mucocutaneous reactions and guide subsequent treatment. The safety of readministration of Rituximab to patients with any of these mucocutaneous reactions has not been determined.\nPrecautions\nLaboratory Monitoring:  Because Rituximab targets all CD20-positive B \nlymphocytes, malignant and nonmalignant, complete blood counts (CBC) and platelet counts should be obtained at regular intervals during Rituximab therapy and more frequently in patients who develop cytopenias. The duration of cytopenias caused by Rituximab can extend well beyond the treatment period.DrugLaboratory Interactions: There have been no formal drug interaction studies performed with Rituximab. However, renal toxicity developed with this drug in combination with cisplatin in clinical trials.HACA Formation: Human antichimeric antibody (HACA) was detected in 4 of 356 patients and 3 had an objective clinical response. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to Rituximab using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (limit of detection  7 ngmL). The observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by several factors including sample handling, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Rituximab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.Immunization: The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines following Rituximab therapy has not been studied. The ability to generate a primary or anamnestic humoral response to vaccination is currently being studied.Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility:  No long-term \nanimal studies have been performed to establish the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of Rituximab, or to determine its effects on fertility in males or females. Individuals of childbearing potential should use effective contraceptive methods during treatment and for up to 12 months following Rituximab therapy.Pregnancy Category C:  Animal reproduction studies have not been \nconducted with Rituximab. It is not known whether Recelbia\n can cause fetal \nharm when administered to a pregnant woman or whether it can affect reproductive capacity. Human IgG is known to pass the placental barrier, and thus may potentially cause fetal B-cell depletion; therefore, Rituximab should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether Recelbia\n is excreted in human \nmilk. Because human IgG is excreted in human milk and the potential for absorption and immunosuppressant in the infant is unknown, women should be advised to discontinue nursing until circulating drug levels are no longer detectable.Pediatric Use:  The safety and effectiveness of Recelbia\n in pediatric \npatients have not been established.\nAdverse reactions\nThe most serious adverse reactions caused by Rituximab include infusion reactions, tumor lysis syndrome, mucocutaneous reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, cardiac arrhythmias and angina, and renal failure. Infusion reactions and lymphopenia are the most commonly occurring adverse reactions.Risk Factors Associated with Increased Rates of Adverse Events:Administration of Rituximab weekly for 8 doses resulted in higher rates of (Grade 3 and 4) adverse events overall (70) compared with administration weekly for 4 doses (57). The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 adverse events was similar in patients retreated with Rituximab compared with initial treatment (58 and 57, respectively). The incidence of the following clinically significant adverse events was higher in patients with bulky disease (lesions _10 cm) (N  39) versus patients with lesions  1 of the patients experienced the following events regardless of causality assessment: agitation, anorexia, arthritis, conjunctivitis, depression, dyspepsia, edema, hyperkinesia, hypertonia, hypesthesia, hypoglycemia, injection site pain, insomnia, lacrimation disorder, malaise, nervousness, neuritis, neuropathy, paresthesia, somnolence, vertigo, weight decrease.\nDisposal\nRituximab is not considered as carcinogenic but as it is a biologic product the vials, syringe or used product must be disposed by putting in 0.5 sodium hupochloride solution and allow 30 minutes to be neutralized or safe for environment.\nOverdosage\nThere has been no experience with overdosage in human clinical trials. Single doses of up to 500 mgm\n2 have been given in controlled clinical trials.\nStorage conditionStore the vial in original carton at 2-8 oC.

      "indications": "Indications\nReplet\n or Replet Plus is indicated for the reduction of atherosclerotic \nevents (myocardial infarction, stroke and vascular death) in-patients with atherosclerosis documented by recent stroke, recent myocardial infarction \nor established peripheral arterial disease. It is also indicated for patients \nwith acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina non-Q-wave MI).",
      "dosage": "Dosage and administration. \nAdministration of Clopidogrel with meals did not significantly modify the \nbioavailability of Clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the \nmain circulating metabolite.\nAbsorption and Distribution\nClopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses of 75 mg Clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (3 mgL) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma \nconcentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to \n150 mg of Clopidogrel.\nAbsorption is at least 50 based on urinary excretion of \nClopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating \nmetabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98 and 94, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 gmL.\nMetabolism and Elimination\nIn vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.\nIndications\nReplet\n or Replet Plus is indicated for the reduction of atherosclerotic \nevents (myocardial infarction, stroke and vascular death) in-patients with atherosclerosis documented by recent stroke, recent myocardial infarction \nor established peripheral arterial disease. It is also indicated for patients \nwith acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina non-Q-wave MI).\nDosage and Administration\nThe recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without \nfood. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable anginanon-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 \nmg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination \nwith Clopidogrel. In studies it was found that most patients with acute coronary syndrome also received heparin acutely.",
      "side_effects": "Side Effects\nThe most common clinically important side effects are pruritus, Diarrhoea and rash. Infrequent events include intracranial haemorrhage (0.4) and neutropaenia (0.04).",
      "contraindications": "Contraindications\nReplet\n or Replet Plus is contraindicated in the following conditions-\nG  Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the   \n    product.\nG  Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial    \n    haemorrhage.\nPrecautions\nAs with other antiplatelet agents, Clopidogrel or Aspirin should be used with caution in-patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery, or other pathological conditions. If a patient is to undergo elective surgery and an antiplatelet effect is not desired, the drug should be discontinued 5 days prior to surgery. Clopidogrel and Aspirin prolong the bleeding time. Patients should be told that it might take them longer than usual to stop bleeding when they take drug, and that they should report any unusual bleeding to their physician.\nUse in Special Populations\nGeriatric Patients\nNo dosage adjustment is needed for the elderly.\nRenally & Hepatically Impaired Patients\nAfter repeated doses of Clopidogrel 75 mg per day, plasma levels of the main circulating metabolite were lower in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance from 5 to 15 mlmin) compared to subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 60 mLmin) or healthy subjects. No dosage adjustment is needed in renally impaired patients. Clopidogrel should be used with caution in hepatically \nimpaired patients.\nPaediatric Use\nSafety and effectiveness in the paediatric population have not been established.\nPregnancy\nAnimal studies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or fetotoxicity due to Clopidogrel. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of a human response, Clopidogrel should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.",

      "indications": "Indications\nReplet\n or Replet Plus is indicated for the reduction of atherosclerotic \nevents (myocardial infarction, stroke and vascular death) in-patients with atherosclerosis documented by recent stroke, recent myocardial infarction \nor established peripheral arterial disease. It is also indicated for patients \nwith acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina non-Q-wave MI).",
      "dosage": "Dosage and administration. \nAdministration of Clopidogrel with meals did not significantly modify the \nbioavailability of Clopidogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the \nmain circulating metabolite.\nAbsorption and Distribution\nClopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of repeated doses of 75 mg Clopidogrel (base), with peak plasma levels (3 mgL) of the main circulating metabolite occurring approximately 1 hour after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating metabolite are linear (plasma \nconcentrations increased in proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to \n150 mg of Clopidogrel.\nAbsorption is at least 50 based on urinary excretion of \nClopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel and the main circulating \nmetabolite bind reversibly in vitro to human plasma proteins (98 and 94, respectively). The binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 100 gmL.\nMetabolism and Elimination\nIn vitro and in vivo, Clopidogrel undergoes rapid hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative. In plasma and urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is also observed.\nIndications\nReplet\n or Replet Plus is indicated for the reduction of atherosclerotic \nevents (myocardial infarction, stroke and vascular death) in-patients with atherosclerosis documented by recent stroke, recent myocardial infarction \nor established peripheral arterial disease. It is also indicated for patients \nwith acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina non-Q-wave MI).\nDosage and Administration\nThe recommended dose of Clopidogrel is 75 mg once daily with or without \nfood. No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal patients. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable anginanon-Q-wave MI), Clopidogrel should be initiated with a single 300 mg loading dose and then continued at 75 mg once daily. Aspirin (75 \nmg-325 mg once daily) should be initiated and continued in combination \nwith Clopidogrel. In studies it was found that most patients with acute coronary syndrome also received heparin acutely.",
      "side_effects": "Side Effects\nThe most common clinically important side effects are pruritus, Diarrhoea and rash. Infrequent events include intracranial haemorrhage (0.4) and neutropaenia (0.04).",
      "contraindications": "Contraindications\nReplet\n or Replet Plus is contraindicated in the following conditions-\nG  Hypersensitivity to the drug substance or any component of the   \n    product.\nG  Active pathological bleeding such as peptic ulcer or intracranial    \n    haemorrhage.\nPrecautions\nAs with other antiplatelet agents, Clopidogrel or Aspirin should be used with caution in-patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery, or other pathological conditions. If a patient is to undergo elective surgery and an antiplatelet effect is not desired, the drug should be discontinued 5 days prior to surgery. Clopidogrel and Aspirin prolong the bleeding time. Patients should be told that it might take them longer than usual to stop bleeding when they take drug, and that they should report any unusual bleeding to their physician.\nUse in Special Populations\nGeriatric Patients\nNo dosage adjustment is needed for the elderly.\nRenally & Hepatically Impaired Patients\nAfter repeated doses of Clopidogrel 75 mg per day, plasma levels of the main circulating metabolite were lower in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance from 5 to 15 mlmin) compared to subjects with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 60 mLmin) or healthy subjects. No dosage adjustment is needed in renally impaired patients. Clopidogrel should be used with caution in hepatically \nimpaired patients.\nPaediatric Use\nSafety and effectiveness in the paediatric population have not been established.\nPregnancy\nAnimal studies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or fetotoxicity due to Clopidogrel. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of a human response, Clopidogrel should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.",

      "dosage": "Dosage & Admimistration:\nAdult: The usual dose of Rhine (Ranitidine) is 150 mg twice daily (in the morning & at bed time). In the \nmanagement of duodenal & gastric ulcer a single daily dose of 300 mg at bed time can be given as an alternative to twice daily administration; peak concentrations in plasma \nare attained within 1 or 2 hours.\nThe half-life for elimination of Ranitidine is 2 to 3 hours. These drugs are in lagre part excreted in the urine \nwithout being metabolized. However, the half-life of Ranitidine is significantly prolonged in patients with \nhepatic dysfunction.\nDosage & Admimistration:\nAdult: The usual dose of Rhine (Ranitidine) is 150 mg twice daily (in the morning & at bed time). In the \nmanagement of duodenal & gastric ulcer a single daily dose of 300 mg at bed time can be given as an alternative to twice daily administration & treatment should be given initially for at least 4 weeks.

Doses should be separated \nby at least 2 hours; no more than 30 mg should be taken in any 24-\nhour period. \nDosage adjustment for special case :\nThe choice of dose should therefore be made on an individual basis, \nweighing the possible benefit of the 10-mg dose with the potential \nrisk for increased adverse events. The safety of treating, on average, \nmore than four headaches in a 30-day period has not been \nestablished.\nPatients receiving propranolol: In patients receiving propranolol, the \n5-mg dose of Rizamig should be used, up to a maximum of 3 doses \nin any 24-hour period.\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\nRizamig should not be given to patients with ischemic heart \ndisease (e.g., angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, or \ndocumented silent ischemia) or to patients who have symptoms or \nfindings consistent with ischemic heart disease, coronary artery \nvasospasm, including Prinzmetals variant angina, or other \nsignificant underlying cardiovascular disease.\nAs Rizamig may increase blood pressure, it should not be given to \npatients with uncontrolled hypertension. Rizamig  is \ncontraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to rizatriptan or \nany of its inactive ingredients.\nWARNINGS\nRizamig  should only be used where a clear diagnosis of migraine \nhas been established. Rizamig should not be given to patients with \ndocumented ischemic or vasospastic coronary artery disease. \nPRECAUTIONS\nDrugs in this class may cause coronary artery vasospasm, patients \nwho experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following \ndosing should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a \npredisposition to Prinzmetals variant angina before receiving \nadditional doses of medication, and should be monitored \nelectrocardiographically. Rizatriptan should be used with caution in \npatients with moderate hepatic insufficiency.\nFor a given attack, if a patient has no response to the first dose of \nrizatriptan, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before \nadministration of a second dose.\nDrug Interactions \nRizatriptan 5 mg should be used in patients taking propranolol. \nErgotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like \ndihydroergotamine or methysergide) and rizatriptan within 24 hours \nis contraindicated.\nCoadministration of rizatriptan and other 5-HT1 agonists within 24 \nhours of each other is not recommended. Rizatriptan should not be \nadministered to patients taking MAO-A inhibitors and non-selective \nMAO inhibitors.\nPregnancy: \nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant \nwomen; therefore, rizatriptan should be used during pregnancy only \nif the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.Nursing Mothers\nIt is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. \nBecause many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be \nexercised when rizatriptan is administered to women who are \nnursing mother. \nPediatric Use\nSafety and effectiveness of rizatriptan in pediatric patients have not \nbeen established; therefore, rizatriptan is not recommended for use \nin patients under 18 years of age.\nUse in the Elderly\nThe pharmacokinetics of rizatriptan were similar in elderly (aged  \n65 years) and in younger adults. Because migraine occurs \ninfrequently in the elderly, clinical experience with rizatriptan is \nlimited in such patients. In clinical trials, there were no apparent \ndifferences in efficacy or in overall adverse experience rates \nbetween patients under 65 years of age and those 65 and above.\nADVERSE REACTIONS\nCardiac events are rare and most have been reported in patients \nwith risk factors predictive of CAD.

During pregnancy and lactation, requirements for \ncalcium  and vitamin-D3 are increased  but in deciding on the required \nsupplementation allowances should be made for availability of these \nagents from other sources. If calcium and iron supplements are both \nrequired to be administered to the patient, they should be taken at \ndifferent  times.

      "composition": "Composition\nEach ﬁlm-coated tablet contains:\nCalcium (as calcium carbonate USP) 600 mg\nVitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol USP)  200 IU\nMagnesium (as magnesium oxide BP)  40 mg\nZinc (as zinc oxide BP)  7.5 mg\nCopper (as cupric oxide BP)  1 mg\nManganese (as manganese Sulphate BP)  1.8 mg\nBoron (as boron citrate BP)  0.25 mg\nMode of action \nCalcium, magnesium and vitamin D3 are the micronutrients \nfor bone. Without vitamin D3 very little calcium is absorbed. \nLike calcium, magnesium increases bone strength and rigidity. Recent epidemiological studies show that some micronutrients like copper, manganese, zinc and boron play important roles in bone health. \nIndication \nPrevention and treatment of osteoporosis; as nutritional supplement; pregnancy and lactation; deﬁciency states of calcium and vitamin D\n3; as adjunct treatment to asthmatics \nto prevent steroid induced osteoporosis; as adjunct treatment to antiseizure\nDosage and administration\n1 tablet twice daily, preferably 1 tablet in the morning and 1 tablet in the evening or as directed by physician. It is best taken with or just after main meals with a full glass of water.\nSide effects\nThe use of calcium supplements has rarely given rise to mild \ngastro-intestinal disturbances such as constipation, \nﬂatulence, nausea, gastric pain, diarrhea. Following administration of vitamin-D\n3 supplements occasional skin \nrash has been reported. Hypercalciuria and in rare cases hypercalcaemia have been seen with long term treatment at \nhigh doses.\nContraindications\nAbsolute contraindications are hypercalcaemia resulting from myeloma, bone metastasis or other malignant bone \ndisease, sarcoidosis; primary hyperparathyroidism and \nVitamin-D\n3 overdosage, Severe renal failure. Hypersensitivity \nto any of the tablet ingredients.Relative contraindications are osteoporosis due to \nprolonged immobilisation, renal stones, severe \nhypercalciuria.\nPrecautions\nPatients with mild to moderate renal failure or mild \nhypercalciuria should be supervised carefully. Periodic \nchecks of plasma calcium levels and urinary calcium excretion  should be made in patients with mild to moderate renal failure or mild hypercalciuria. Urinary calcium excretion should also be measured. In patients with a history \nof renal stones urinary calcium excretion should be \nmeasured to exclude hypercalciuria. With long term treatment it is advisable to monitor serum  and urinary calcium levels and kidney function, and reduce and stop \ntreatment temporarily if urinary calcium exceeds  7.5 \nmmol24 hours. Allowances should be made for calcium and \nvitamin-D\n3 supplements from other sources.\nPregnancy and lactationDuring pregnancy and lactation treatment should always be under the direction of a physician. During pregnancy and lactation, requirements for calcium  and vitamin-D\n3 are \nincreased  but in deciding on the required supplementation allowances should be made for availability of these agents from other sources. If calcium and iron supplements are both required to be administered to the patient, they should \nbe taken at different  times. Overdoses of vitamin-D\n3 have \nshown teratogenic effects in pregnant animals. In humans \nlong term hypercalcaemia  can lead to physical  and mental retardation, aortic stenosis and retinopathy in a new born child. Vitamin-D\n3 and its metabolites pass into the breast \nmilk.\nDrug Interaction\nThe risk of hypercalcaemia should be considered in patients taking thiazide diuretics since these drugs can reduce urinary calcium excretion. Hypocalcaemia must be avoided in digitalised patients. Certain foods (e.g. those containing oxalic acid, phosphate or phytinic acid) may reduce the absorption of calcium. Concomitant treatment with phenytoin or barbiturates can decrease the effect of Vitamin-D\n3 because of metabolic activation. Concomitant \nuse of glucocorticoids can decrease the effect of Vitamin-D\n3. The effects of digitalis and other cardiac \nglycosides may be attenuated with the oral administration of calcium combined with Vitamin-D\n3. Strict medical \nsupervision is needed and, if necessary monitoring of ECG and calcium. Calcium salts may reduce the absorption of thyroxin, bisphosphonates, sodium ﬂuoride, quinolone or tetracycline antibiotics or iron. It is advisable to allow a \nminimum period of four hours before taking the calcium.\nStorage\nStore below 25\n0C in a cool and dry place.

      "contraindications": "Contraindications\nAbsolute contraindications are hypercalcaemia \nresulting for example from myeloma, bone metastases \nor other malignant bone disease, sarcoidosis; high \namount of calcium in urine and blood, primary \nhyperparathyroidism and Vitamin-D3 overdosage. \nSevere renal failure. Hypersensitivity to any of the tablet \ningredients.\nWarning & Precautions\nPatients with mild to moderate renal failure or mild \nhypercalciuria should be supervised carefully. Periodic \nchecks of plasma calcium levels and urinary calcium \nexcretion  should be made in patients with mild to \nmoderate renal failure or mild hypercalciuria. Urinary \ncalcium excretion should also be measured. In patients \nwith a history of renal stones urinary calcium excretion \nshould be measured to exclude hypercalciuria. With \nlong term treatment it is advisable to monitor serum  \nand urinary calcium levels and kidney function, and \nreduce and stop treatment temporarily if urinary \ncalcium exceeds  7 .5 mmol24 hours. Before taking \nCalcium Orotate, precaution is needed if the patient \nhas any allergies.",
      "drug_interactions": "Drug Interaction\nThe risk of hypocalcaemia should be considered in \npatients taking thiazide diuretics since these drugs can \nreduce urinary calcium excretion. Hypocalcaemia must be avoided in digitalised patients. Certain foods (e.g. \nthose containing oxalic acid, phosphate or phytanic \nacid) may reduce the absorption of calcium. The \neffects of digitalis and other cardiac glycosides may be \nattenuated with the oral administration of calcium \ncombined with Vitamin-D\n3. Calcium salts may reduce \nthe absorption of thyroxin, bisphosphonates, sodium \nfluoride, levothyroxine, phenytoin, quinolone or \ntetracycline antibiotics or iron. It is advisable to allow a \nminimum period of four hours before taking the \ncalcium. Thiazide type diuretics can interact with \ncalcium supplements, increasing the risks of hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria.\nOverdosage\nSymptoms include nausea, vomiting, polyuria and \nconstipation.

      "composition": "Composition\nRocipro 500: Each film coated tablet contains Ciprofloxacin \nHydrochloride USP 555 mg equivalent to Ciprofloxacin  500 mg.\nRocipro 750: Each film coated tablet contains Ciprofloxacin \nHydrochloride USP 832.50 mg equivalent to Ciprofloxacin  750 mg.\nMechanism of Action\nRocipro containing ciprofloxacin is a synthetic quinolone anti-\ninfective agent. Ciprofloxacin has broad spectrum of activity. It is \nactive against most gram-negative aerobic bacteria including \nEnterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ciprofloxacin is \nalso active against gram-positive aerobic bacteria including \npenicillinase producing, non penicillinase producing, and methicillin \nresistant staphylococci, although many strains of streptococci are \nrelatively resistant to the drug. The bactericidal action of \nciprofloxacin results from interference with the enzyme DNA gyrase \nneeded for the synthesis of bacterial DNA.\nFollowing oral administration it is rapidly and well absorbed from the \nG.I. tract. It is widely distributed into the body tissues and fluids. The \nhalf life is about 3.5 hours. About 30 to 50 of an oral dose of \nciprofloxacin is excreted in the urine within 24 hours as unchanged \ndrug and biologically active metabolites.\nIndications\nCiprofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of single infection or \nmixed infections caused by two or more susceptible organisms. It \ncan also be used for infections caused by organisms resistant to \nother antibiotics including Aminoglycosides, Penicillins and \nCephalosporins.\nAs antibacterial concentrations of ciprofloxacin are obtained in \nserum and body tissues as well as in the urine following \nadministration by mouth, Ciprofloxacin has been suggested for  use \nin the treatment of a wide range of infections caused by susceptible \norganisms including infections of the urinary, respiratory and \ngastrointestinal tracts, gonorrhoea and septicaemia. The extensive \ntissue penetration of ciprofloxacin combined with its enhanced \nantibacterial activity (including antipseudomonal activity), enables \nCiprofloxacin to be used alone (pending sensitivity results) or in \ncombination with an Aminoglycoside or with beta lactam antibiotics \nfor instance when severe neutropenia is present or with an antibiotic \nactive against anaerobes where the presence of bacteroides fragilis \nis suspected. Rocipro is indicated for the treatment of the following \ninfections caused by sensitive bacteria:\nSevere systemic infections: e.g. septicaemia, bacteraemia, peritonitis, \ninfections in immunosuppressed  patients with haematological or \nsolid tumors and in patients in intensive care unit with specific \nproblems such as infected burns.\nRespiratory tract infections: Lobar and bronchopneumonia, acute and \nchronic bronchitis, acute exacerbation of cystic fibrosis, \nbronchiectasis, empyema.\nUrinary tract infections: Uncomplicated and complicated urethritis, \ncystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, epididymitis.\nSkin and soft tissue infections: e.g. infected ulcers, wound infections, \nabscesses, cellulitis, otitis externa, erysipelas, infected burns.\nGastro-intestinal infections: e.g. enteric fever, infective diarrhea.  \nInfection of the biliary tract: e.g. cholangitis, cholecystitis, empyema \nof the gall bladder.\nIntra abdominal infections: e.g. peritonitis, intra abdominal \nabscesses.\nBone and joint infection: Osteomyelitis, septic arthritis.\nPelvic infections: e.g. salpingitis, endometritis, pelvic inflammatory \ndiseases.\nEye, ear, nose and throat infections: e.g. otitis media, sinusitis, \nmastoiditis, tonsillitis.\nGonorrhoea: Including urethral, rectal and pharyngeal gonorrhoea \ncaused by beta-lactamase  producing organism or organisms \nmoderately sensitive to penicillin.\nDosage And Administration\nGeneral dosage recommendations: The dosage of the ciprofloxacin is \ndetermined by the severity and type of infection, the sensitivity of the \ncausative organism(s) and the age, weight and renal function of the \npatient.\nAdults: The dosage range for adults is 100-750 mg twice daily.\nIn infections of the lower and upper urinary tract (depending on \nseverity): 250-500 mg twice daily.\nIn respiratory tract infections: 250-500mg twice daily for both upper \nand lower respiratory tract infections, depending on the severity. For \nthe treatment of known Streptococcus pneumonia infection, the \nrecommended dosage is 750 mg twice daily.\nIn gonorrhoea: A single dose of 250 or 500 mg.In the majority other infections, 500-750 mg twice daily should be \nadministered.\nCystic fibrosis: In adults with pseudomonal infections of the lower \nrespiratory tract , the normal dose is 750 mg twice daily.\nAs the pharmacokinetics of Ciprofloxacin remain unchanged in \npatients with cystic fibrosis, the low body weight of these patients \nwould be fallen into consideration when determining dosage.\nImpaired renal function: Dosage adjustment is not usually required \nexcept in patients with severe renal impairment. (serum creatinine  \n265 micro moll or creatinine clearance  20 mlminute). If adjustment \nis necessary, this may be achieved by reducing the total daily dose by \nhalf, although monitoring of drug serum levels provide the most \nreliable basis for dose adjustment.\nElderly: Although higher ciprofloxacin serum levels are found in the \nelderly, no adjustment of dosage is necessary.\nAdeloscents and children: As with other drugs in its class, \nciprofloxacin has been shown to cause arthropathy in weight bearing \njoints of immature animals. Although the relevance of this to man is \nunknown, its use in children, growing children and growing \nadolescents is not recommended. However, where the benefit of \nusing ciprofloxacin is considered to outweigh the potential risk, the \ndosage should be 7.5-15 mgkgday depending upon the severity of \ninfection, administered in two divided doses.\nDuration of treatment: The duration of treatment depends upon the \nseverity of infection, clinical response and bacteriological findings.\nFor acute infections the usual treatment period is 5 to 10 days with \nRocipro tablets. Generally treatment should be continued for three \ndays after the signs and symptoms of the infection have disappeared. \nUse In Pregnancy And Lactation\nReproduction studies performed in mice, rats and rabbits using \nparenteral and oral administration did not reveal any evidence of \nteratogenicity, impairment of fertility or impairment of peripost natal \ndevelopment. However as with other quinolones, Ciprofloxacin has \nbeen shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals and therefore \nits use during pregnancy is not recommended. Studies in rats have \nindicated that Ciprofloxacin is secreted in milk, administration to \nnursing mothers is thus not recommended.\nPrecaution And Warning\nIt should be used with caution in patients with suspected or known \nCNS disorders such as arteriosclerosis or epilepsy or other factors \nwhich predispose to seizures and convulsion.\nInformation For Patients\n  Ciprofloxacin may be taken with or without meals and to drink \nfluids liberally.\n   Concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin should be avoided with \nmagnesiumaluminium antacids, or sucralfate or with other \nproducts containing calcium, iron and zinc. These products may \nbe taken two hours after or six hours before ciprofloxacin.\n  Ciprofloxacin should not be taken concurrently with milk or yogurt \nalone, since absorption of ciprofloxacin may be significantly \nreduced. Dietary calcium is a part of a meal, however, does not \nsignificantly affect the ciprofloxacin absorption.\nContraindication\nPatients with a history of hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin or to other \nquinolones. \nAdverse Reaction\nAdverse effects include nausea and other gastrointestinal \ndisturbance, headache, dizziness and skin rashes.

Rocipro is indicated for the treatment of the following \ninfections caused by sensitive bacteria:\nSevere systemic infections: e.g. septicaemia, bacteraemia, peritonitis, \ninfections in immunosuppressed  patients with haematological or \nsolid tumors and in patients in intensive care unit with specific \nproblems such as infected burns.\nRespiratory tract infections: Lobar and bronchopneumonia, acute and \nchronic bronchitis, acute exacerbation of cystic fibrosis, \nbronchiectasis, empyema.\nUrinary tract infections: Uncomplicated and complicated urethritis, \ncystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, epididymitis.\nSkin and soft tissue infections: e.g. infected ulcers, wound infections, \nabscesses, cellulitis, otitis externa, erysipelas, infected burns.\nGastro-intestinal infections: e.g. enteric fever, infective diarrhea.  \nInfection of the biliary tract: e.g. cholangitis, cholecystitis, empyema \nof the gall bladder.\nIntra abdominal infections: e.g. peritonitis, intra abdominal \nabscesses.\nBone and joint infection: Osteomyelitis, septic arthritis.\nPelvic infections: e.g. salpingitis, endometritis, pelvic inflammatory \ndiseases.\nEye, ear, nose and throat infections: e.g. otitis media, sinusitis, \nmastoiditis, tonsillitis.\nGonorrhoea: Including urethral, rectal and pharyngeal gonorrhoea \ncaused by beta-lactamase  producing organism or organisms \nmoderately sensitive to penicillin.\nDosage And Administration\nGeneral dosage recommendations: The dosage of the ciprofloxacin is \ndetermined by the severity and type of infection, the sensitivity of the \ncausative organism(s) and the age, weight and renal function of the \npatient.\nAdults: The dosage range for adults is 100-750 mg twice daily.\nIn infections of the lower and upper urinary tract (depending on \nseverity): 250-500 mg twice daily.\nIn respiratory tract infections: 250-500mg twice daily for both upper \nand lower respiratory tract infections, depending on the severity. For \nthe treatment of known Streptococcus pneumonia infection, the \nrecommended dosage is 750 mg twice daily.\nIn gonorrhoea: A single dose of 250 or 500 mg.In the majority other infections, 500-750 mg twice daily should be \nadministered.\nCystic fibrosis: In adults with pseudomonal infections of the lower \nrespiratory tract , the normal dose is 750 mg twice daily.\nAs the pharmacokinetics of Ciprofloxacin remain unchanged in \npatients with cystic fibrosis, the low body weight of these patients \nwould be fallen into consideration when determining dosage.\nImpaired renal function: Dosage adjustment is not usually required \nexcept in patients with severe renal impairment. (serum creatinine  \n265 micro moll or creatinine clearance  20 mlminute). If adjustment \nis necessary, this may be achieved by reducing the total daily dose by \nhalf, although monitoring of drug serum levels provide the most \nreliable basis for dose adjustment.\nElderly: Although higher ciprofloxacin serum levels are found in the \nelderly, no adjustment of dosage is necessary.\nAdeloscents and children: As with other drugs in its class, \nciprofloxacin has been shown to cause arthropathy in weight bearing \njoints of immature animals. Although the relevance of this to man is \nunknown, its use in children, growing children and growing \nadolescents is not recommended. However, where the benefit of \nusing ciprofloxacin is considered to outweigh the potential risk, the \ndosage should be 7.5-15 mgkgday depending upon the severity of \ninfection, administered in two divided doses.\nDuration of treatment: The duration of treatment depends upon the \nseverity of infection, clinical response and bacteriological findings.\nFor acute infections the usual treatment period is 5 to 10 days with \nRocipro tablets. Generally treatment should be continued for three \ndays after the signs and symptoms of the infection have disappeared. \nUse In Pregnancy And Lactation\nReproduction studies performed in mice, rats and rabbits using \nparenteral and oral administration did not reveal any evidence of \nteratogenicity, impairment of fertility or impairment of peripost natal \ndevelopment. However as with other quinolones, Ciprofloxacin has \nbeen shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals and therefore \nits use during pregnancy is not recommended. Studies in rats have \nindicated that Ciprofloxacin is secreted in milk, administration to \nnursing mothers is thus not recommended.\nPrecaution And Warning\nIt should be used with caution in patients with suspected or known \nCNS disorders such as arteriosclerosis or epilepsy or other factors \nwhich predispose to seizures and convulsion.\nInformation For Patients\n  Ciprofloxacin may be taken with or without meals and to drink \nfluids liberally.\n   Concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin should be avoided with \nmagnesiumaluminium antacids, or sucralfate or with other \nproducts containing calcium, iron and zinc. These products may \nbe taken two hours after or six hours before ciprofloxacin.\n  Ciprofloxacin should not be taken concurrently with milk or yogurt \nalone, since absorption of ciprofloxacin may be significantly \nreduced. Dietary calcium is a part of a meal, however, does not \nsignificantly affect the ciprofloxacin absorption.\nContraindication\nPatients with a history of hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin or to other \nquinolones. \nAdverse Reaction\nAdverse effects include nausea and other gastrointestinal \ndisturbance, headache, dizziness and skin rashes.  Crystalluria has \noccurred with high doses.\nHow Supplied\nRocipro  500: Box containing  3X10s tablets in blister pack.\nRocipro  750: Box containing  2X8s tablets in blister pack.\nStorage\nStore in a cool and dry place below 30 ºC.

      "description": "Description\nRupatadine is a non-sedating anti-allergic compound which displays strong antagonist activity towards both histamine H1 receptors and Platelet- Activating Factor (PAF) receptors. PAF and histamine are known to complement and promote secretion of each other. PAF induces vasodilatation and an increase in vascular permeability, which may be responsible for the appearance of rhinorrhoea and nasal congestion. PAF may have a major role in the late phase allergic reaction. Rupatadines PAF antagonistic activity represents the likely mechanism behind the inhibition of eosinophil migration which  has  been  suggested  to  be  beneficial  in  the  treatment  of  chronic urticaria.",

      "composition": "Composition \nRovast 5 mg: Each tablet contains Rosuvastatin Calcium BP 5.21 mg \nequivalent to Rosuvastatin 5 mg.\nRovast 10 mg: Each tablet contains Rosuvastatin Calcium BP 10.42 mg \nequivalent to Rosuvastatin 10 mg.\nRovast 20 mg: Each tablet contains Rosuvastatin Calcium BP 20.84 mg \nequivalent to Rosuvastatin 20 mg.\nProperties & Effects \nRosuvastatin calcium is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent. \nRosuvastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme \nA (HMG-CoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of \nHMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early and rate-limiting step in \ncholesterol biosynthesis.\nPharmacokinetics\nAbsorption\nIn clinical pharmacology studies in man, the peak plasma \nconcentrations of Rosuvastatin were reached 3 to 5 hours following \noral dosing. Both peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under \nthe plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increase in proportion to \nRosuvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of Rosuvastatin is \napproximately 20. Administration of Rosuvastatin with food \ndecreases the rate of drug absorption by 20 as assessed by Cmax, \nbut there is no effect on the extent of absorption as assessed by \nAUC.\nDistribution \nMean volume of distribution at steady-state of Rosuvastatin is \napproximately 134 liters. Rosuvastatin is 88 bound to plasma \nproteins, mostly albumin. The binding is reversible and independent \nof plasma concentrations. \nMetabolism\nRosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized; approximately 10 of a \nradiolabeled dose is recovered as metabolite. The major metabolite is \nN-desmethyl rosuvastatin, which is formed principally by cytochrome \nP450 2C9. N-desmethyl rosuvastatin has approximately one-sixth to \none-half the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity of Rosuvastatin. \nOverall, more than 90 of active plasma HMG-CoA reductase \nactivity is contributed by Rosuvastatin. \nExcretion\nFollowing oral administration, Rosuvastatin and its metabolites are \nprimarily excreted in the feces (90). The elimination half-life (t 12) \nof Rosuvastatin is approximately 19 hours.\nSpecial Populations\nGender\nThere is no difference in plasma concentrations of Rosuvastatin \nbetween men and women.\nGeriatric\nThere is no difference in plasma concentrations of Rosuvastatin \nbetween the nonelderly and elderly populations (age 65 years). \nPediatric\nIn Pharmacokinetic study in pediatric population (10 to 17 years of \nage with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia), both Cmax \nand AUC of Rosuvastatin were similar to values observed in adult \nsubjects administered the same doses. \nRenal Insufficiency\nMild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance CLcr 30 \nmlmin1.73 m2) has no influence on plasma concentrations when \noral dose of 20 mg Rosuvastatin is administered for 14 days. \nHowever, plasma concentration of Rosuvastatin is increased to a \nclinically significant extent (about 3-fold) in patients with severe \nrenal impairment (CLcr30 mlmin1.73 m2).\nHemodialysis\nSteady-state plasma concentration of Rosuvastatin  in patients with \nchronic hemodialysis is  approximately 50 greater compared with \nhealthy subjects with normal renal functions. \nHepatic Insufficiency\nIn patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma \nconcentrations of Rosuvastatin are modestly increased.\nIndications\n1. Patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia as an \nadjunct to diet to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-c, ApoB, nonHDL-c \nand TG levels and to increase HDL-c, 2. Patients with \nhypertriglyceridemia as an adjunct to diet, 3. Patients with primary \ndysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III hyperlipoproteinemia) as an adjunct \nto diet, 4. Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia \n(HoFH) to reduce LDL-c, total-c, and ApoB, 5. Slowing the \nprogression of atherosclerosis as part of a treatment strategy to \nlower total-c andLDl-c as an adjunct to diet, 6. Pediatric patients 10 \nto 17 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia \n(HeFH) to reduce elevated total-c, LDl-c and ApoB after failing an \nadequate trial of diet therapy, 7 . Risk reduction of MI, stroke, and \narterial revascularization procedures in patients without clinically \nevident CHD, but with multiple risk factors.\nDosage and administration\n5-40 mg once daily with or without food at any time of the day. 40 \nmg only for patients not reaching LDL-c goal with 20 mg. In pediatric \npatients 10-17 yrs of age with HeFH, the usual dose range is 5-20 \nmgday; doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this \npatient population.\nContraindications\nRosuvastatin is contraindicated in patients with a known \nhypersensitivity to any component of the product. Rosuvastatin is \ncontraindicated in patients with active liver disease or with \nunexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases.Precautions\nBefore instituting therapy with Rosuvastatin, an attempt should be \nmade to control hypercholesterolemia with appropriate diet, exercise, \nand weight reduction in obese patients and treatment of underlying \nmedical problems. Administration of Rosuvastatin 20 mg to patients \nwith severe renal impairment (CLcr30 mlmin1.73 m2) resulted in a \n3-fold increase in plasma concentrations compared with healthy \nsubjects.\nPregnancy and Lactation\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are contraindicated during \npregnancy and in nursing mothers. Rosuvastatin should be \nadministered to women of childbearing age only when such patients \nare highly unlikely to conceive and have been informed of the \npotential hazards. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this \ndrug, therapy should be discontinued and the patient apprised of the \npotential hazard to the fetus.\nAdverse Reactions\nRosuvastatin is generally well tolerated. Adverse reactions have \nusually been mild and transient. 3.7 patients discontinued the \ntherapy due to adverse experiences attributed to Rosuvastatin. The \nmost frequent adverse events thought to be related to Rosuvastatin \nwere myalgia, constipation, asthenia, abdominal pain and nausea.\nDrug Interactions\nRosuvastatin clearance is not dependent on metabolism by \ncytochrome P450 3A4 to a clinically significant extent. This is \nconfirmed in studies with known cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors \n(ketoconazole, erythromycin, itraconazole).\nKetoconazole\nCoadministration of ketoconazole with Rosuvastatin (80 mg) resulted \nin no change in plasma concentration of Rosuvastatin.\nErythromycin\nCoadministration of erythromycin with Rosuvastatin (80 mg) \ndecreased AUC and Cmax of Rosuvastatin by 20 and 31 \nrespectively.

      "dosage": "Dosage and Administration of Rosuvastatin with food \ndecreases the rate of drug absorption by 20 as assessed by Cmax, \nbut there is no effect on the extent of absorption as assessed by \nAUC.\nDistribution \nMean volume of distribution at steady-state of Rosuvastatin is \napproximately 134 liters. Rosuvastatin is 88 bound to plasma \nproteins, mostly albumin. The binding is reversible and independent \nof plasma concentrations. \nMetabolism\nRosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized; approximately 10 of a \nradiolabeled dose is recovered as metabolite. The major metabolite is \nN-desmethyl rosuvastatin, which is formed principally by cytochrome \nP450 2C9. N-desmethyl rosuvastatin has approximately one-sixth to \none-half the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity of Rosuvastatin. \nOverall, more than 90 of active plasma HMG-CoA reductase \nactivity is contributed by Rosuvastatin. \nExcretion\nFollowing oral administration, Rosuvastatin and its metabolites are \nprimarily excreted in the feces (90). The elimination half-life (t 12) \nof Rosuvastatin is approximately 19 hours.\nSpecial Populations\nGender\nThere is no difference in plasma concentrations of Rosuvastatin \nbetween men and women.\nGeriatric\nThere is no difference in plasma concentrations of Rosuvastatin \nbetween the nonelderly and elderly populations (age 65 years). \nPediatric\nIn Pharmacokinetic study in pediatric population (10 to 17 years of \nage with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia), both Cmax \nand AUC of Rosuvastatin were similar to values observed in adult \nsubjects administered the same doses. \nRenal Insufficiency\nMild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance CLcr 30 \nmlmin1.73 m2) has no influence on plasma concentrations when \noral dose of 20 mg Rosuvastatin is administered for 14 days. \nHowever, plasma concentration of Rosuvastatin is increased to a \nclinically significant extent (about 3-fold) in patients with severe \nrenal impairment (CLcr30 mlmin1.73 m2).\nHemodialysis\nSteady-state plasma concentration of Rosuvastatin  in patients with \nchronic hemodialysis is  approximately 50 greater compared with \nhealthy subjects with normal renal functions. \nHepatic Insufficiency\nIn patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma \nconcentrations of Rosuvastatin are modestly increased.\nIndications\n1. Patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia as an \nadjunct to diet to reduce elevated total-C, LDL-c, ApoB, nonHDL-c \nand TG levels and to increase HDL-c, 2. Patients with \nhypertriglyceridemia as an adjunct to diet, 3. Patients with primary \ndysbetalipoproteinemia (Type III hyperlipoproteinemia) as an adjunct \nto diet, 4.

      "dosage": "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\nCONTRA-INDICATION\nRozith is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to azithromycin, erythromycin, any macrolide or ketolide antibiotic.  \nWARNING & PRECAUTION\nLiver is the principle route of elimination of azithromycin, caution should be exercised when azithromycin is administered to patients \nwith impaired hepatic function. If any allergic reaction occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be \ninstituted.\nSIDE EFFECTS\nAzithromycin is well tolerated with a low incidence of side effects. Most frequently reported side effects are related to Gastrointestinal \nsystem with diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence, melena. Allergic reactions such as rash, edema, urticria have occured and \nthere have also been rare reports of  serious hypersensitivity reactions. Transient mild reductions in neutrophil counts have occasionally \nbeen observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. \nUSE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\nPregnancy:  Pregnancy Category B. In the animal studies, no evidence of harm to the fetus due to azithromycin was found. Animal \nreproduction studies are not always predictive of human response; azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly \nneeded.\nNursing Mothers: It is not known whether azithromycin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, \ncaution should be exercised when azithromycin is administered to a nursing woman.\nUSE IN CHILDREN & ADOLESCENTS\nAzithromycin is safe & effective for the treatment of children   6 months of age.\nDRUG INTERACTION\nWith medicine:  Careful monitoring of patients is advised if azithromycin is concurrently used with digoxin & ergot derivatives, as there \nis possibility of increased concentration of digoxin and theoretical possibility of ergotism. There have been no pharmacokinetic drug \ninteractions between azithromycin and warfarin, theophylline, carbamazepine, methylprednisolone and cimetidine.\nWith food & others:  Azithromycin absorption was reduced in presence of food & antacid. So, azithromycin should be administered 1 \nhour before or 2 hour after taking food & antacid.\nOVERDOSAGE\nMost adverse events experienced in higher then recommended doses were similar in type and may be more frequent than those seen at \nnormal doses. The incidence of tinnitus and ototoxicity is more frequent in overdosage than at normal doses. In the event of overdosage, \ngeneral symptomatic and supportive measures are indicated as required.\nSTORAGE\nStore at temperature not exceeding  30 ºC in a dry place.

      "side_effects": "SIDE EFFECTS\nAzithromycin is well tolerated with a low incidence of side effects. Most frequently reported side effects are related to Gastrointestinal \nsystem with diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, flatulence, melena. Allergic reactions such as rash, edema, urticria have occured and \nthere have also been rare reports of  serious hypersensitivity reactions. Transient mild reductions in neutrophil counts have occasionally \nbeen observed in clinical trials, although a causal relationship to azithromycin has not been established. \nUSE IN PREGNANCY & LACTATION\nPregnancy:  Pregnancy Category B. In the animal studies, no evidence of harm to the fetus due to azithromycin was found. Animal \nreproduction studies are not always predictive of human response; azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly \nneeded.\nNursing Mothers: It is not known whether azithromycin is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, \ncaution should be exercised when azithromycin is administered to a nursing woman.\nUSE IN CHILDREN & ADOLESCENTS\nAzithromycin is safe & effective for the treatment of children   6 months of age.",
      "contraindications": "Not Found",
      "drug_interactions": "DRUG INTERACTION\nWith medicine:  Careful monitoring of patients is advised if azithromycin is concurrently used with digoxin & ergot derivatives, as there \nis possibility of increased concentration of digoxin and theoretical possibility of ergotism. There have been no pharmacokinetic drug \ninteractions between azithromycin and warfarin, theophylline, carbamazepine, methylprednisolone and cimetidine.\nWith food & others:  Azithromycin absorption was reduced in presence of food & antacid. So, azithromycin should be administered 1 \nhour before or 2 hour after taking food & antacid.\nOVERDOSAGE\nMost adverse events experienced in higher then recommended doses were similar in type and may be more frequent than those seen at \nnormal doses. The incidence of tinnitus and ototoxicity is more frequent in overdosage than at normal doses. In the event of overdosage, \ngeneral symptomatic and supportive measures are indicated as required.",

      "composition": "Composition\nSilinor-M 50500 Tablet:  Each film coated tablet contains \nSitagliptin 50 mg as Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate INN 64.25 mg and Metformin Hydrochloride BP 500 mg. \nSilinor-M\n 501000 Tablet: Each film coated tablet contains \nSitagliptin 50 mg as Sitagliptin Phosphate Monohydrate INN \n64.25 mg and Metformin Hydrochloride BP 1000 mg. \nPharmacology\nSilinor-M combines two antihyperglycemic agents with \ncomplementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and Metformin hydrochloride, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing \nthe inactivation of incretin hormones. Incretin hormones, \nincluding glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and \nglucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are \nreleased by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are \nincreased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an \nendogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of \nglucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are \nnormal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, Sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. The pharmacologic mechanism of action of Metformin is different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. \nIndication And Usage\nSilinor-M\n is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to \nimprove glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus when treatment with both Sitagliptin and Metformin \nis appropriate.\nDosage And Administration\nDose of this combination should be individualized on the basis \nof the patients current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability \nwhile not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 100 mg Sitagliptin and 2000 mg Metformin. SitagliptinMetformin combination should generally be given twice daily with meals, with gradual dose escalation, to reduce \nthe gastrointestinal (GI) side effects due to Metformin. The \nrecommended starting dose in patients not currently treated with Metformin is 50 mg Sitagliptin500 mg Metformin hydrochloride twice daily, with gradual dose escalation recommended to reduce gastrointestinal side effects \nassociated with Metformin. The starting dose in patients \nalready treated with Metformin should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and the dose of Metformin already being taken. For patients taking Metformin 850 mg twice daily, the recommended starting \ndose of this combination is 50 mg Sitagliptin1000 mg \nMetformin hydrochloride twice daily.\nPatients treated with an insulin secretagogue or insulin\nCo-administration of the combination with an insulin \nsecretagogue (e.g. sulfonyl urea) or insulin may require lower \ndoses of the insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.\nPrecautions\nDo not use the combination of Sitagliptin & Metformin in \npatients with hepatic disease. \nG Before initiating the \ncombination and at least annually thereafter, assess renal function and verify as normal. G May need to discontinue the \ncombination and temporarily use insulin during periods of \nstress and decreased intake of fluids and food as may occur with fever, trauma, infection or surgery. \nContraindications\nCombination (SitagliptinMetformin) is contraindicated in \npatients with: \nG Renal disease or renal dysfunction, e.g., as \nsuggested by serum creatinine levels 1.5 mgdL males), 1.4 \nmgdL females. G Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, \nincluding diabetic ketoacidosis, with or without coma. G \nHistory of serious hypersensitivity reaction to the combination or sitagliptin, such as anaphylaxis or angioedema.\nAdverse Effects\nThe most common (5) adverse reactions due to initiation of Metformin therapy are diarrhea, nauseavomiting, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, indigestion, asthenia, and headache. \nDrug Interaction\nCationic drugs (e.g., amiloride, digoxin, morphine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, ranitidine,triamterene, trimethoprim, or vancomycin) that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion theoretically have the potential for interaction with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. Co-administration of Digoxin and Sitagliptin may slightly increase the mean peak drug concentration of Digoxin. But no dosage adjustment of digoxin or Sitagliptin is recommended. \nUse in Pregnancy & Lactation\nPregnancy:Pregnancy Category B. The combination of Sitagliptin & Metformin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. \nNursing Mothers:\nIt is not known whether Sitagliptin is excreted in human milk.\nGeriatric Use:\nBecause Sitagliptin and Metformin are substantially excreted by the kidney, and because aging can be associated with reduced renal function, combination of Sitagliptin and \nMetformin should be used with caution as age increases. Care \nshould be taken in dose selection and should be based on careful and regular monitoring of renal function. \nPediatric Use:\nSafety and effectiveness of SitagliptinMetformin in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established \nSupply\nSilinor-M\n 50500 Tablet: Each box contains 3X7s tablets in \nAlu-Alu blister pack.\nSilinor-M 501000 Tablet: Each box contains 3X8s tablets in \nAlu-PVDC blister pack.\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30 ºC in a dry place.

      "description": "Description\nSitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which \nis believed to exert its actions  in  patients  with  type  2  \ndiabetes  by  slowing  the  inactivation  of  incretin hormones. \nIncretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) \nand glucosedependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are \nreleased by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are \nincreased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly \ninactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an \nendogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of \nglucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are \nnormal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis \nand release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular \nsignaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers \nglucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to \nreduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and \nprolonging active incretin levels,  Sitagliptin  increases  insulin  \nrelease  and  decreases  glucagon  levels  in  the circulation in \na glucose-dependent manner.\nIndication\nSilinor is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to \nimprove glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus. It is also indicated for use in combination with \nMetformin, Sulfonylurea or Thiazolidinediones when diet and \nexercise plus the single agent does not provide adequate \nglycemic control.\nDosage and administration\nTake Silinor exactly as prescribed by physicians.\nUsual dose:100 mg once daily by mouth with or without food.\n For patients with mild renal insufficiency (creatinine \nclearance, CrCl-- 50mlmin), no dosage adjustment is required\n For patients with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl  30 to \n50 \nKo.Ku.KoKja) rPPZ fJPhr P oJJ kKrmftPjr hrTJr jA\n p xm rJVLr oiqo oJJr KTcKj xoxqJ (KPKaKjj \nKTJPrÀ30 yPf 30Ko.Ku.KoKja) mJ F ö rjJu KcK rPPZ \nfJPhr P oJJ 25 Ko.VJ. ähKjT FTmJr\nKmË mqmyJr S xJmiJjfJ\nKjÍKuKUf P KxaJKVkKaj mqmyJr TrJ gPT Kmrf gJTPf yPm:\n aJAk-1 cJJPmKax\n cJJPmKaT KTPaJIqJKxPcJKxx\n KxaJKVkKaPjr kKf xPmhjvLufJ TjPxKan yJat lAKuSr\n KTcKj xoxqJ\n pTPfr xoxqJ\nkJvt kKfKJ\nFuJKt Kjf xoxqJ, IVJvPr khJy, KTcKjr xoxqJ, IJkJr \nrxKkPraKr AjPlTvj, TJïTJKbjq, mKo, oJgJmqgJ knKf \nkJvt kKfKJ hUJ pPf kJPr\nVntJmúJ S jqhJjTJPu mqmyJr\nVntJmúJ KxaJKVkKaj mqmyJr jJ TrJ Co\nKxaJKVkKaj oJfhMP KjÓxOf y KTjJ fJ JjJ pJKj\nkJrüKrT KJ\nIjqJjq HwPir xJPg KxaJKVkKaPjr IJKJ xJ kptJÂ \nfgq kJSJ pJKj\noJJKiTq\nFPP hsÆf KYKTÒxPTr krJovt Kjj\nmJKeKqT oJzT\nKxKujr 25 Ko.VJ. aqJmPua: kKfKa mJP IJPZ 3x10Ka \naqJmPua KmöJr kqJPT\nKxKujr 50 Ko.VJ. aqJmPua: kKfKa mJP IJPZ 1x10Ka \naqJmPua KmöJr kqJPT\nKxKujr 100 Ko.VJ. aqJmPua: kKfKa mJP IJPZ 1x10Ka \naqJmPua KmöJr kqJPT\nxre\næì úJPj 30 ºx. fJkoJJr jLPY xre TËj IJPuJ Fm \nIJhstfJ gPT hNPr rJUMj\n  xTu kTJr SwMi KvæPhr jJVJPur mJAPr rJUMj\nKmJKrf fPgqr jq APrK Iv kzÊj",

When blood glucose concentrations are \nnormal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis \nand release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular \nsignaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers \nglucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to \nreduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and \nprolonging active incretin levels,  Sitagliptin  increases  insulin  \nrelease  and  decreases  glucagon  levels  in  the circulation in \na glucose-dependent manner.\nIndication\nSilinor is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to \nimprove glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes \nmellitus. It is also indicated for use in combination with \nMetformin, Sulfonylurea or Thiazolidinediones when diet and \nexercise plus the single agent does not provide adequate \nglycemic control.",

      "composition": "Composition\nSilverax : Each gram cream contains 10 mg Silver Sulfadiazine USP.\nPharmacologyThe mechanism of Silver Sulfadiazines antibacterial action has not been fully elucidated. After exposure to \nthe drug, structural changes in the bacterial cell membrane occur, including distortion and enlargement of the \ncell and a weakening of the cell wall membrane. This is accompanied by reduced viability in sensitive strains. \nThe silver sulfadiazine molecule dissociates and the silver moiety is bound to the bacterial cells. It is believed \nthat, after penetrating the cell wall, the silver moiety is attached to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and prevents \nbacterial cell proliferation. There is approximately 100 times more DNA in mammalian cells than in bacterial \ncells. It is thought that the ratio of silver sulfadiazine to bacterial DNA is sufficiently high to prevent bacterial \ndivision but the corresponding ratio to epithelial DNA is low enough not to block epithelial cell regeneration. \nThe sulfadiazine moiety also provides a bacteriostatic action against sensitive organisms. In adults, up to 10 \nof the sulfadiazine may be absorbed and 60 to 85 of the absorbed amount is excreted in the urine. In \nchildren with 13 body surface area burns, the urinary sulfadiazine concentration was 31.8 mgL.\nIndication1. The topical prophylaxis against bacterial colonization and infection in burn wounds. 2. The topical antibacterial management of certain contaminated or infection-prone wounds, other than burns.\nDosage & AdministrationThe burn wounds are cleansed, and Silverax\n is applied over the burn wound. The burn areas should be \ncovered with Silverax at all times. The cream should be applied once to twice daily to a thickness of \napproximately 116 inches or 1.5 mm. Whenever necessary; the cream should be reapplied to any areas from \nwhich it has been removed by patient activity. If individual patient requirements make dressings necessary, \nthey may be used. Reapplication should be ensured immediately after hydrotherapy. Treatment with Silverax \nshould be continued until satisfactory healing is occurred, or until the burn site is ready for grafting. The drug \nshould not be withdrawn from the therapeutic regimen while there remains the possibility of infection except \nif a significant adverse reaction occurs.\nContraindicationIt is contraindicated in-patients who are hypersensitive to it or any of the other ingredients in the preparation. \nIt should not be used on pregnant women approaching or at term, on premature infants, or on newborn \ninfants during the first 2 months of life.\nSide EffectSeveral cases of transient leukopenia have been reported in-patients receiving Silver Sulfadiazine therapy. \nOther infrequently occurring events include skin necrosis, erythema multiform, skin discoloration, burning \nsensation, rashes, and interstitial nephritis.\nPrecautionGeneral If hepatic and renal functions become impaired and elimination of drug decreases, accumulation may \noccur and discontinuation of this should be weighed against the therapeutic benefit being achieved. In \nconsidering the use of topical proteolytic enzymes in conjunction with it, the possibility should be noted that \nsilver might inactivate such enzymes. Laboratory Tests In the treatment of burn wounds involving extensive \nareas of the body, the serum sulfa concentrations may approach adult therapeutic levels (8 mg to 12 mg). \nTherefore, in these patients it would be advisable to monitor serum sulfa concentrations. Renal function \nshould be carefully monitored and the urine should be checked for sulfa crystals.\nUse in Pregnancy and LactationTeratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly \njustified, especially in pregnant women approaching or at term. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether \nSilver Sulfadiazine is excreted in human milk.

      "composition": "Composition\nSkilox 250  : Each capsule contains Flucloxacillin Sodium \nBP 272 mg equivalent to Flucloxacillin 250 mg.\nSkilox 500  : Each capsule contains Flucloxacillin Sodium \nBP 544 mg equivalent to Flucloxacillin 500 mg.\nSkilox Syrup : Each 5 mL contains Flucloxacillin Sodium \nBP 136 mg equivalent to Flucloxacillin 125 mg.\nPharmacology\nFlucloxacillin is an isoxazolyl penicillin which combines the \nproperties of resistance to hydrolysis by penicillinase, \ngastric acid stability and activity against gram-positive \nbacteria.  Flucloxacillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that is \nparticularly useful against penicillinase producing \nstaphylococci.  Flucloxacillin kills bacteria by interfering in \nthe synthesis of the bacterial cell wall.  Flucloxacillin binds \nto penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) on the bacterial cell \nwall, thus interfering with peptidoglycan synthesis. \nPeptidoglycan is a heteropolymeric structure that provides \nthe cell wall with its mechanical stability.  The final stage of \npeptidoglycan synthesis involves the completion of the \ncross-linking with the terminal glycine residue of the \npentaglycin bridge linking to the fourth residue of the \npentapeptide (D-alanine).  The transpeptidase cell wall is \nweakened, the cell swells and then ruptures.  Flucloxacillin \nresists the action of bacterial penicillinase probably \nbecause of the steric hindrance induced by the acyl side \nchain which prevents the opening of the β-lactam ring.\nIndication\nSkilox is indicated for the treatment of infections due to \ngram-positive organisms, including infections caused by \nβ-lactamase producing staphylococci.\nTypical indications include\nSkin and soft tissue infections: boils, abscesses, \ncarbuncles, furunculosis, cellulitis; infected skin conditions, \ne.g. ulcer, eczema and acne; infected wounds, infected \nburns, protection for skin grafts, otitis media and externa, \nimpetigo.\nRespiratory tract infections: pneumonia, lung abscess, \nempyema, sinusitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, quinsy.\nOther infection caused by flucloxacillin-sensitive \norganisms: osteomyelitis, enteritis, endocarditis, urinary \ntract infection, meningitis, septicaemia.  Skilox is also \nindicated for use as a prophylactic agent during major \nsurgical procedures where appropriate; for example, \ncardiothoracic and orthopaedic surgery. \nDosage And Administration\nOral doses should be administered half to one hour before \nmeals.\nUsual adult dosage (including elderly patients): Oral-250 mg \nfour times daily.\nSevere infections: dosage should be doubled.\nOsteomyelitis, endocarditis: upto 8 g daily, in divided doses \n6 to 8 hourly.\nIn case of secondary bacterial infection in chicken pox:  \nSkilox 500 six hourly should be prescribed.\nUsual children dosage:\n2-10 years: half of the adult dose.\nUnder 2 years: quarter of the adult dose.Impaired renal function: In common with other penicillins, \nSkilox usage in patients with renal impairment does not \nusually require dosage reduction.  However in the presence \nof severe renal failure (creatinine clearance  10mLmin) a \nreduction in dose or an extension of dose interval should be \nconsidered.\nFlucloxacillin is not significantly removed by dialysis and \nhence no supplementary dosages need to be administered \neither during or at the end of the dialysis period.\nContraindication\nPenicillin hypersensitivity.\nSide Effects\nSide effects as with other penicillin, are uncommon and \nmainly of a mild and transitory nature.  Gastro-intestinal \nupsets (e.g. nausea, diarrhoea) and skin rashes have been \nreported. If a skin rash occurs, treatment should be \ndiscontinued.\nDrug Interaction\nThe administration of probenecid with Flucloxacillin results \nin higher serum peak concentrations and prolongs the time \nthat therapeutic concentrations of Flucloxacillin are \nachieved in serum.  Physical incompatibility andor loss of \nactivity of Flucloxacillin  in solution has been reported \nwhen given with gentamycin sulphate, streptomycin \nsulphate, vitamin mixtures.

      "composition": "Composition\nEach capsule contains orlistat INN 60 mg as active \ningredient.\nMechanism of action\nOrlistat is a potent, specific and long-acting lipase \ninhibitor. It exerts its therapeutic activity in the lumen \nof the stomach and upper small intestine by forming \na covalent bond with the active serine site of gastric \nand pancreatic lipases. The inactivated enzyme is \nthus rendered unable to hydrolyze dietary fats in the \nform of triglycerides into absorbable free fatty acids \nand monoglycerides. As undigested triglycerides \ncannot be absorbed, a caloric deficit arises which has \na positive effect on weight control. Systemic \nabsorption of orlistat is therefore not needed for \nactivity. At the recommended therapeutic dose of 60 \nmg three times a day, orlistat inhibit dietary fat \nabsorption by approximately 30. \nIndications\nAdults:\nOrlistat is indicated in conjunction with a mildly \nhypocaloric diet for the treatment of obese patients \nwith a body mass index (BMI) 30 kgm2 and \noverweight patients (BMI 28 kgm2) with associated \nrisk factors such as type II diabetes, hyperlipidemia \nand hypertension.\nTreatment with orlistat should be discontinued after 12 \nweeks in patients who have not lost at least 5 of their \nbody weight as measured at the start of drug therapy.\nAdolescents (12 years & older)\nObese adolescents should be treated with orlistat \nonly if an adequate reduction of body weight cannot \nbe achieved by means of diet & increased physical \nactivity. Treatment with orlistat should be considered \nin particular if complications of obesity are present. \nDosage and Administration\nThe recommended dose of orlistat is one 60 mg cap \nto be taken immediately before, during, or up to one \nhour after each main meal. If a meal is missed or \ncontains no fat, the dose of orlistat should be omitted.\nDoses of orlistat above 60 mg three times daily have \nnot been shown to provide additional benefits.\nThe effect of orlistat results in an increase in fecal fat \n24-48 hours after dosing. Upon discontinuation of \ntherapy, fecal fat content usually returns to \npretreatment levels within 48-72 hours.\nSafety & efficacy of orlistat were investigated in \nclinical studies lasting up to 4 years.\nThe recommended dose of orlistat for adolescents is \nas same as adults.\nSpecial dosage instruction\nThe tolerability and efficacy of orlistat have not been \nstudied in elderly patients, or patients with hepatic \nandor renal impairments.\nContraindications\nOrlistat is contraindicated in patients with chronic \nmalabsorption syndrome, in patients with cholestasis \nand in patients who are hypersensitive to orlistat or to \nany of the other ingredients of the capsules.\nPrecautions\nIn clinical trial, the decrease in body weight with \norlistat therapy was less in type II diabetic patients \nthan in nondiabetic patients. Antidiabetic drug \ntreatment should be closely monitored during orlistat \ntherapy. Because of the improvement in glycemic \ncontrol, the dose of oral antidiabetics or of insulin \nmay need to be adjusted. Patients should be advised to adhere to the dietary recommendations. The \nprobability of occurrence of gastrointestinal side \neffects may increase when orlistat is taken with a \nfatty meal. The daily intake of fat should be \ndistributed between three main meals.\nPatients should be strongly encouraged to take a \nmultivitamin supplement that contains fat soluble \nvitamins to ensure adequate nutrition because \norlistat has been shown to reduce the absorption of \nsome fat soluble vitamins & beta-carotene. In \naddition, the levels of vitamin D & beta-carotene may \nbe low in obese patients compared with non-obese \npatients.\nUndesirable effects\nUndesirable effects of orlistat are largely \ngastrointestinal in nature. Common gastrointestinal \nside effects are oily spotting from the rectum, \nflatulence, fecal urgency, oily or fatty stool, abdominal \ndiscomfort, stomach pain, incontinence (stools), \nrunnyliquid stools, more frequent bowel motions etc.\nInfluenza, bleeding from the back passage (rectum), \ndiverticulitis (symptoms may include lower stomach \npain, particularly on the left side, possibly with fever \nand constipation), pancreatitis (symptoms may \ninclude severe abdominal pain sometimes radiating \ntowards the back, possible with fever, nausea and \nvomiting), skin blistering, severe stomach pain \ncaused by gallstones, hepatitis (symptoms can \ninclude yellow skin and eyes, itching, stomach pain \nand liver tenderness), anxiety, headache, fatigue etc \nmay rarely occur in some patients.\nRare cases of hypersensitivity have been reported. \nMain clinical symptoms are pruritus, exanthema, \nurticaria, angioedema and anaphylaxis.\nIn clinical studies undesirable side effects of orlistat \nwere generally mild & transient & did not lead to \ncessation of treatment.\nInteractions\nNo interactions with commonly prescribed \nmedications such as alcohol, digoxin, nifedipine, oral \ncontraceptives, phenytoin, pravastatin, warfarin, or \nmetformin, glibenclamide, fibrates, furosemide, \ncaptopril, or atenolol have been observed in studies.\nPregnancy and Lactation\nNo clinical data are available on pregnancies \nexposed to orlistat. As it is not known whether orlistat \nis excreted in breast milk, orlistat should not be used \nduring breastfeeding.\nHow supplied\nSlimfast capsules: Each Box contains 1x12s, 2x12s, \n3x12s, 4x12s  capsules in blister pack.\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30 ºC in a dry \nplace.

      "description": "Description\nSolivo consists of Naproxen (enteric-coated, delayed release core) \nand Esomeprazole (as esomeprazole magnesium trihydrate, \nimmediate release layer surrounding the core). As a result, \nEsomeprazole is released first into the stomach, prior to the \ndissolution of Naproxen in the small intestine. The enteric coating \nprevents naproxen release at pH levels below 5.5.\nNaproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with \nanalgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic properties. The \nmechanism of action of Naproxen is to inhibit prostaglandin \nsynthesis. Esomeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that suppresses \ngastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the HK-ATPase in \nthe gastric parietal cell. By acting specifically on the proton pump, \nEsomeprazole blocks the final step in acid production, thus reducing \ngastric acidity.",

      "indications": "Indications\nIt is indicated for the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, \nrheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and to decrease the \nrisk of developing gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing \nNSAID-associated gastric ulcers. Solivo is not recommended for \ninitial treatment of acute pain because the absorption of naproxen is \ndelayed compared to absorption from other naproxen containing \nproducts.",
      "dosage": "Dosage and Administration\nCarefully consider the potential benefits and risks of Solivo and \nother treatment options before deciding to use Solivo. Use the \nlowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with \nindividual patient treatment goals. Solivo does not allow for \nadministration of a lower daily dose of esomeprazole. If a dose of \nesomeprazole lower than a total daily dose of 40 mg is more \nappropriate, a different treatment should be considered.\n\tRheumatoid Ar thritis\t Solivo 375 Tablet\t\n1 tablet twice daily\tOsteoar thritis and\tSolivo  500 Tablet \tAnkylosing Spondylitis \nThe tablets are to be swallowed whole with liquid. Do not split, chew, \ncrush or dissolve the tablet. Solivo is to be taken at least 30 minutes \nbefore meals. \nGeriatric Patients \nStudies indicate that although total plasma concentration of \nnaproxen is unchanged, the unbound plasma fraction of naproxen is \nincreased in the elderly. Use caution when high doses are required \nand some adjustment of dosage may be required in elderly patients. \nAs with other drugs used in the elderly use the lowest effective dose.\nPatients with Moderate to Severe Renal Impairment \nNaproxen-containing products are not recommended for use in \npatients with moderate to severe or severe renal impairment \n(creatinine clearance 30 mLmin). \nHepatic Insufficiency \nMonitor patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment closely \nand consider a possible dose reduction based on the naproxen \ncomponent of Solivo. Solivo is not recommended in patients with \nsevere hepatic impairment because esomeprazole doses should not \nexceed 20 mg daily in these patients.\nPediatric Patients \nThe safety and efficacy of Solivo in children younger than 18 years \nhas not been established. Solivo is therefore not recommended for \nuse in children.",

      "dosage": "Dosage & Administration\nSwallow Rabeprazole capsule whole with a glass of water. The capsule must not be chewed or crushed. For the treatment of \nduodenal ulcers take Rabeprazole capsule delayed-release tablets after a meal. For Helicobacter pylori  eradication take \nRabeprazole capsule with food. For all other indications Rabeprazole capsule can be taken with or without food. \nPharmacokinetics \nAfter oral administration of 20 mg Rabeprazole delayed release capsule, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of Rabeprazole occur \nover a range of 2 to 5 hours (Tmax). The Rabeprazole Cmax and AUC are linear over an oral dose range of 10 mg to 40 mg. There is \nno appreciable accumulation when doses of 10 mg to 40 mg are administered every 24 hours; the pharmacokinetics of \nRabeprazole is not altered by multiple dosing. \nAbsorption \nAbsolute bioavailability for a 20 mg oral capsule of Rabeprazole (compared to intravenous administration) is approximately 52. \nWhen rabeprazole delayed release tablets are administered with a high fat meal, Tmax is variable; which concomitant food intake \nmay delay the absorption up to 4 hours or longer. However, the Cmax and the extent of Rabeprazole absorption (AUC) are not \nsignificantly altered. Thus Rabeprazole Capsule s may be taken without regard to timing of meals. \nDistribution \nRabeprazole is 96.3 bound to human plasma proteins.\nMetabolism\nRabeprazole is extensively metabolized. A significant portion of Rabeprazole is metabolized via systemic nonenzymatic reduction \nto a thioether compound. Rabeprazole is also metabolized to sulphone and desmethyl compounds via cytochrome P450 in the \nliver. The thioether and sulphone are the primary metabolites measured in human plasma. These metabolites were not observed \nto have significant antisecretory activity. In vitro studies have demonstrated that Rabeprazole is metabolized in the liver primarily \nby cytochromes P450 3A (CYP3A) to a sulphone metabolite and cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) to desmethyl Rabeprazole. \nCYP2C19 exhibits a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some sub-populations (e.g., 3 to 5 of Caucasians and \n17 to 20 of Asians). Rabeprazole metabolism is slow in these sub-populations, therefore, they are referred to as poor \nmetabolizers of the drug. \nExcretion\nFollowing a single 20 mg oral dose of 14C-labeled Rabeprazole, approximately 90 of the drug was eliminated in the urine, \nprimarily as thioether carboxylic acid; its glucuronide, and mercapturic acid metabolites. The remainder of the dose was \nrecovered in the feces. Total recovery of radioactivity was 99.8. No unchanged Rabeprazole was recovered in the urine or \nfeces.\nContraindication \nRabeprazole capsule is contraindicated in patient with known hypersensitivity to any of the formulation. \nPrecaution\nRabeprazole capsule should be used carefully if the patient has severe liver dysfunction and severe renal impairment. \nAdverse Reaction\nMost common adverse reactions in adults (2) are pain, pharyngitis, flatulence, infection, and constipation.\nMost common adverse reactions in adolescents (2) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\nDrug Interaction\nRabeprazole is metabolized by the Cytochrome P-450 (CYP-450) drug metabolizing enzyme system. Rabeprazole does not have \nclinically significant interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP-450 system, such as Warfarin, Theophylline, Diazepam \nand Phenytoin etc.\nOverdose\nThere is no experience with large overdoses with Rabeprazole. The maximum reported overdose is 80 mg. There are no clinical \nsigns or symptoms associated with any reported overdose. Patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have been treated with up to \n120 mg Rabeprazole once daily. No specific antidote for Rabeprazole is known.\nUse in Pregnancy and Lactation\nThere are no available human data on Rabeprazole capsule use in pregnant women to inform the drug associated risk. Lactation \nstudies have not been conducted to assess the presence of Rabeprazole capsule in human milk.\nPediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of Rabeprazole capsule have been established in pediatric patients for adolescent patients 12 years \nof age and older.\nHepatic Impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 25 ºC in a dry place.

      "description": "Description\nTamisolMR (Tamsulosin Hydrochloride) is an alpha1-adrenoceptor \nantagonist. Tamsulosin binds selectively and competitively to \npostsynaptic alpha1-receptors, in particular to the subtype alpha1A \nwhich bring about relaxation of the smooth muscle of the prostate, \nwhereby tension is reduced.",
      "composition": "Not Found",
      "indications": "Indications and usage\nTreatment of functional symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It relaxes smooth muscle in benign prostatic hyperplasia \nproducing an increase in urinary flow-rate and an improvement in \nobstructive symptoms.",
      "dosage": "Dosage and Administration\nOne capsule daily, to be taken after the same meal each day.The \ncapsule should be swallowed whole and should not be crunched or \nchewed as this will interfere with the modified release of the active \ningredient.",
      "side_effects": "Side effects\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported during the use \nof Tamsulosin Hydrochloride: dizziness, abnormal ejaculation and, \nless frequently (1-2) headache, asthenia, postural hypotension, \npalpitations and rhinitis. Gastrointestinal reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation can occasionally occur. \nHypersensitivity reactions such as rash, pruritus, and urticaria can \noccur occasionally. As with other alpha-blockers, drowsiness, blurred \nvision, dry mouth or oedema can occur.",
      "contraindications": "Contraindications\nHypersensitivity to tamsulosin hydrochloride or any other component of the \nproduct; a history of orthostatic hypotension; severe hepatic insufficiency.\nPrecautionsAs with other alpha\n1 blockers, a reduction in blood pressure can \noccur in individual cases during treatment with Tamisol MR, as a \nresult of which, rarely, syncope can occur. At the first signs of \northostatic hypotension (dizziness, weakness) the patient should sit or lie down until the symptoms have disappeared. Before therapy \nwith Tamisol\nMR is initiated the patient should be examined in \norder to exclude the presence of other conditions which can cause the same symptoms as benign prostatic hyperplasia.",
      "drug_interactions": "Drug Interactions\nNo interactions have been seen when Tamsulosin Hydrochloride was \ngiven concomitantly with either atenolol, enalapril , nifedipine or \ntheophylline. Concomitant cimetidine brings about a rise in plasma \nlevels of tamsulosin, and frusemide a fall, but as levels remain within \nthe normal range posology need not be changed. Neither does \ntamsulosin change the free fractions of diazepam, propranolol, \ntrichlormethiazide, and chlormadinon.\nPregnancy & Lactation\nNot applicable as Tamisol\nMR  is intended for male patients only.\nOverdosage\nNo cases of acute overdosage have been reported. However, acute \nhypotension could theoretically occur after overdosage in which case \ncardiovascular support should be given. Blood pressure can be \nrestored and heart rate brought back to normal by lying the patient \ndown. Measures, such as emesis, can be taken to impede \nabsorption. When large quantities are involved, gastric lavage can be \napplied and activated charcoal and an osmotic laxative, such as \nsodium sulphate, can be administered.\nHow Supplied\nEach box contains 5x6s capsule in Alu-Alu blister.",

      "composition": "COMPOSITION\nTeana AM Tablet  405 mg: Each ﬁlm coated tablet contains \nTelmisartan USP  40 mg and Amlodipine Besylate USP 6.93 mg \nequivalent to Amlodipine 5 mg.\nTeana AM  Tablet 805 mg: Each ﬁlm coated tablet contains \nTelmisartan USP 80 mg and Amlodipine Besylate USP 6.93 mg \nequivalent to Amlodipine 5 mg.\nPHARMACOLOGY\nTeana AM is a ﬁxed dose combination of Telmisartan Hydrochloride & \nAmlodipine. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstricting and aldosterone- \nsecreting effects of Angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding \nof Angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular \nsmooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine \ncalcium channel blocker that inhibits the transmembrane inﬂux of \ncalcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. \nAmlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on \nvascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular \nresistance and reduction in blood pressure.\nINDICATIONS\nTeana AM is indicated for the treatment of hypertension alone or \nwith other antihypertensive agents. This combination may also be \nused as initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple \nantihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals. \nDOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\nThe usual starting dose of Teana AM is 405 mg once daily. Patients \nrequiring larger blood pressure reduction may be started with 805 \nmg once daily. Dosage must be individualized and may be increased \nafter at least 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 8010 mg once daily. \nCONTRAINDICATIONS\nKnown hypersensitivity (e.g., anaphylaxis or angioedema) to Telmisartan, \nAmlodipine or any other component of this product.  \nPRECAUTION\nAvoid fetal or neonatal exposure, titrate slowly in patients with hepatic \nor severe renal impairment, heart failure patients need to be \nmonitored, avoid concomitant use of an ACE inhibitor and ARB. \nUncommonly, initiating a CCB in patients with severe obstructive \ncoronary artery disease may precipitate myocardial infarction or \nincreased angina. \nSIDE EFFECTS\nHeadache, edema, hypotension, dizziness, palpitations.USE IN PREGNANCY AND LACTATION\nPregnancy: Pregnancy Category D. \nLactation: Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing \ninfant, decide whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, \ntaking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.\nUSE IN PEDIATRIC AND GERIATRIC PATIENTS\nPediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not \nbeen established.\nGeriatric Use: Not recommended in patients 75 years of age and older.\nHepatic Impairment: Initial therapy with Telmisartan & Amlodipine \ncombination is not recommended in hepatically impaired patients.\nDRUG INTERACTIONS\nThis combination shows drug-drug interaction with Digoxin, Lithium, \nNSAIDS, COX-2 Inhibitors, Ramipril, Ramiprilat.\nOVERDOSES\nLimited data are available with regard to overdose in humans.

Where appropriate, Teicoplanin should be administered in combination with other antibacterial agents.",
      "dosage": "Dosage and Administration\nTeicoplanin can be given intravenously (as a bolus injection or infusion) or intramuscularly. The intravenous injection may be administered either as a bolus over 3 to 5 minutes or as a 30-minute infusion. Only the infusion method should be used in neonates. It should be given once daily after one or more loading doses. The dosage of Teicoplanin should be adapted on the severity of the infection and patients response to treatment.In adults (Normal kidney function)- On the first day, a dose of 6 mgkg (generally 400 mg) intravenously \nis recommended. On the following days, the dose may be 6 \nmgkgday (generally 400 mg) intravenously or 3 mgkgday (generally 200 mg) intravenously or intramuscularly as a single daily dose. The highest dose and the intravenous route are recommended for serious infections.\n- In potentially fatal infections, treatment should be started with 6 \nmgkg (usually 400 mg) twice daily for 1 to 4 days (loading dose) and continued with 6 mgkgday intravenously on the following days (maintenance dose). In adults and elderly (Kidney failure)\nIn patients with kidney failure, the dosage should be adjusted from \nthe 4th day of treatment as follows:- In moderate kidney failure (creatinine clearance between 40 and 60 mlmin), the daily dose of Teicoplanin should be halved or given on alternate days.\n- In severe kidney failure (creatinine clearance less than 40 mlmin) \nand in hemodialysis patients, the daily dose of Teicoplanin should be reduced to a third, or given every 3 days.- If creatinine clearance is equal to or less than 20 mlmin, treatment with Teicoplanin may be given only if monitoring of drug levels in the \nblood can be guaranteed.\nIn children (Normal kidney function)In Children (2 months to 12 years): Treatment should be started at a dose of 10 mgkg every 12 hours for a total of 3 doses and then continued at a dose of 6-10 mgkgday, the highest dose being used \nfor the most serious infections or for children with neutropenia. \nIn neonates (up to 2 months): Treatment should be started at a dose of 16 mgkg on the first day, followed by maintenance doses of 8 mgkgday by slow intravenous infusion ( lasting approximately 30 \nminutes). \nIn children (Kidney failure)\nAs like adults, dosage adjustment is recommended. Measuring Teicoplanin levels in the blood may be useful to make treatment as effective as possible.\nClostridium difficile infection associated diarrhea\nThe recommended dose is 100-200 mg administered twice a day for 7 to 14 days.Giving Teicoplanin along with another suitable bactericidal antibiotic is recommended for infections requiring maximum bactericidal \nactivity or in situations where the presence of Gram-negative \nbacteria cannot be ruled out (empirical treatment of fever in patients with neutropenia).In most patients, this medicine can be seen to have an effect 48 to 72 hours after the start of treatment. However, the total duration of \ntreatment is determined based on the type and severity of the \ninfection and the patients response to treatment. In endocarditis and osteomyelitis, a period of at least 3 weeks is recommended. Reconstitution DirectionInject slowly the 3 ml of water from the ampoule into the 200 mg or 400 mg powder vial containing Teicoplanin active ingredient. Rotate the vial gently between hands until all the powder is dissolved to \navoid foaming. If foam is developed, allow the solution to stand for \napproximately 15 minutes so that the foam disappears. Only clear \nand yellowish solutions should be used.Teicoplanin can be administered in the following infusion solutions: - Sodium chloride 9 mgml (0.9) solution \n- Ringer solution \n- Ringer-lactate solution \n- 5 dextrose solution - 10 dextrose solution - 0.18 sodium chloride and 4 glucose solution \n- 0.45 sodium chloride and 5 glucose solution",

      "composition": "Composition\nTplase : Each vial contains sterile, lyophilized powder of Tenecteplase INN 50 mg & \neach vial contains 10 ml water for injection.\nPharmacology\nTenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator that is derived \nfrom native t-PA by modifications at three sites of the protein structure. It binds to the \nfibrin component of the thrombus (blood clot) and selectively converts \nthrombus-bound plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the fibrin matrix of the \nthrombus. Tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to\ninactivation by its endogenous inhibitor (PAI-1) compared to native t-PA.\nTenecteplase binds to fibrin rich clots via the fibronectin finger-like domain and the \nKringle 2 domain. The protease domain then cleaves the ArgVal bond in plasminogen \nto form plasmin. Plasmin in turn degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus, thereby \nexerting its thrombolytic action.\nIndications\nAcute phase of myocardial infarction (AMI). \nDosage & Administration\nTenecteplase should be administered on the basis of body weight, with a maximum \ndose of 50 mg tenecteplase.\nThe required dose should be administered as a single intravenous bolus over 5 to 10 \nseconds.\nReconstitution\n1. Remove the syringe from the supplied JMI complimentary pouch and aseptically \nwithdraw 10 mL of Sterile Water for Injection(SWFI), USP, from the supplied diluent \nvial. Do not use Bacteriostatic Water for Injection, USP.\n2. Inject the entire contents of the syringe (10 mL) into the Tplase vial directing the \ndiluent stream into the powder. Slight foaming upon reconstitution is not unusual; any \nlarge bubbles will dissipate if the product is allowed to stand undisturbed for several \nminutes.\n3. Gently swirl until contents are completely dissolved. DO NOT SHAKE. The \nreconstituted preparation results in a colorless to pale yellow transparent solution \ncontaining Tplase at 5 mgmL at a pH approximately 7 .30-7 .50.\n4. Determine the appropriate dose of Tplase (see Dose Information Table) and \nwithdraw this volume (in milliliters) from the reconstituted vial with the syringe. Any \nunused solution should be discarded.\n5. Once the appropriate dose of Tplase is drawn into the syringe, stand the shield \nvertically on a flat surface.\nContraindications\nActive internal bleeding; history of cerebrovascular accident; intracranial or intraspinal \nsurgery, or trauma within 2 months; intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous \nmalformation, or aneurysm; known bleeding diathesis; and severe uncontrolled \nhypertension.\nPrecautions\nGeneral\nStandard management of myocardial infarction should be implemented concomitantly \nwith Tplase treatment. Arterial and venous punctures should be minimized. \nNoncompressible arterial puncture must be avoided and internal jugular and \nsubclavian venous punctures should be avoided to minimize bleeding from the \nnoncompressible sites. In the event of serious bleeding, heparin and antiplatelet \nagents should be discontinued immediately. Heparin effects can be reversed by \nprotamine.\nReadministration\nReadministration of plasminogen activators, including Tplase, to patients who have \nreceived prior plasminogen activator therapy has not been systematically studied. \nThree of 487 patients tested for antibody formation to Tplase had a positive antibody \ntiter at 30 days. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were \nconsidered positive for antibodies to Tplase in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay, and \nare highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the \nobserved incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several \nfactors including sample handling, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. \nFor these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Tplase with the \nincidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. Although sustained \nantibody formation in patients receiving one dose of Tplase has not been \ndocumented, readministration should be undertaken with caution.\nHypersensitivity\nHypersensitivity, including urticarial  anaphylactic reactions, have been reported after\nadministration of Tplase (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, laryngeal edema, rash, and \nurticaria).Monitor patients treated with Tplase during and for several hours after \ninfusion. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, appropriate therapy should be initiated.Side effects\nBleeding\nThe most frequent adverse reaction associated with Tplase is bleeding. If serious \nbleeding occurs, concomitant heparin and antiplatelet therapy should be discontinued. \nDeath or permanent disability can occur in patients who experience stroke or serious \nbleeding episodes.For Tplase-treated patients in ASSENT-2, the incidence of \nintracranial hemorrhage was 0.9 and any stroke was 1.8. The incidence of all \nstrokes, including intracranial bleeding, increases with increasing age. \nNon-intracranial major bleeding and the need for blood transfusions were lower in \npatients treated with Tplase.Types of major bleeding reported in 1 or more of the \npatients were hematoma (1.7) and gastrointestinal tract (1). Types of major \nbleeding reported in less than 1 of the patients were urinary tract, puncture site \n(including cardiac catheterization site), retroperitoneal, respiratory tract, and \nunspecified. Types of minor bleeding reported in 1 or more of the patients were \nhematoma (12.3), urinary tract (3.7), puncture site (including cardiac \ncatheterization site) (3.6), pharyngeal (3.1), gastrointestinal tract (1.9), epistaxis \n(1.5), and unspecified (1.3).\nCarcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nStudies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential, \nmutagenicity, or the effect on fertility.\nPregnancy & Lactation\nThe benefit of treatment must be evaluated against the potential risks in case of \nmyocardial infarction during pregnancy. It is not known if tenecteplase is excreted into \nbreast milk.\nNursing Mothers\nIt is not known if Tplase is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted \nin human milk, caution should be exercised when tenecteplase is administered to a \nnursing woman.\nPediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of tenecteplase in pediatric patients have not been \nestablished.\nGeriatric Use\nOf the patients in ASSENT-2 who received tenecteplase, 4,958 (59) were under the \nage of 65; 2,256 (27) were between the ages of 65 and 74; and 1,244 (15) were 75 \nand over. The 30-day mortality rates by age were 2.5 in patients under the age of 65, \n8.5 in patients between the ages of 65 and 74, and 16.2 in patients age 75 and \nover. The ICH rates were 0.4 in patients under the age of 65, 1.6 in patients \nbetween the ages of 65 and 74, and 1.7 in patients age 75 and over. The rates of any \nstroke were 1.0 in patients under the age of 65, 2.9 in patients between the ages of \n65 and 74, and 3.0 in patients age 75 and over. Major bleeding rates, defined as \nbleeding requiring blood transfusion or leading to hemodynamic compromise, were \n3.1 in patients under the age of 65, 6.4 in patients between the ages of 65 and 74, \nand 7 .7 in patients age 75 and over. In elderly patients, the benefits of tenecteplase \non mortality should be carefully weighed against the risk of increased adverse events, \nincluding bleeding.\nOther Side effcets\nThe following adverse reactions have been reported among patients receiving \ntenecteplase in clinical trials. These reactions are frequent sequelae of the underlying \ndisease, and the effect of tenecteplase on the incidence of these events is unknown. \nThese events include cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, atrioventricular block, \npulmonary edema, heart failure, cardiac arrest, recurrent myocardial ischemia, \nmyocardial reinfarction, myocardial rupture, cardiac tamponade, pericarditis, \npericardial effusion, mitral regurgitation, thrombosis, embolism, and electromechanical \ndissociation. These events can be life-threatening and may lead to death. Nausea \nandor vomiting, hypotension, and fever have also been reported.\nDrug interactions\nNo formal interaction studies with Tenecteplase and medicinal products commonly \nadministered in patients with AMI have been performed. Medicinal products that \naffect coagulation or those that alter platelet function may increase the risk of \nbleeding prior to, during or after Tenecteplase therapy.\nOverdose\nIn the event of overdose there may be an increased risk of bleeding. In case of severe \nprolonged bleeding substitution therapy may be considered (plasma, platelets),\nStorage\nStore lyophilized Tplase at temperature not exceeding 3 0C or under refrigerator \n2-8C.\nPacking\nTenecteplase 50 mg: Each box contains 1 vial containing 50 mg tenecteplase & 1 vial \ncontaining 10 ml water for injection.\n  Medicine: Keep out of reach of children\n13001837Tplase\nTenecteplase\nManufactured by\nHealthcare Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\nGazariapara, Mirzapur, Rajendrapur\nGazipur-1703, BangladeshPatients body Tenecteplase Volume of reconstituted\nweight (mg) solution\ncategory (kg)  (ml)\n 60 30 6\n 60 to  70 35 7\n 70 to  80 40 8\n 80 to  90 45 9\n 90 50 10",

      "composition": "COMPOSITION\nTrexall Tablet 2.5 mg : Each film-coated tablet contains \nMethotrexate USP 2.5 mg.Trexall\n Tablet 10 mg : Each film-coated tablet contains \nMethotrexate USP 10 mg.\nPHARMACOLOGY\nMethotrexate inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase. Dihydrofolates must be reduced to tetrahydrofolates by this enzyme before they can be utilized as carriers of one-carbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate. Therefore, methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis, repair, and cellular replication. Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells, bone marrow, fetal cells, buccal and intestinal mucosa, and cells of the urinary bladder are in general more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate. When cellular proliferation in malignant tissues is greater than in most normal tissues, methotrexate may impair malignant growth without irreversible damage to normal tissues. In psoriasis, the rate of production of epithelial cells in the skin is greatly increased over normal skin. This difference in proliferation rates is the basis for the use of methotrexate to control the psoriatic process.\nINDICATIONS \ni) Neoplastic Diseases \n Treatment of gestational choriocarcinoma, chorioadenoma \ndestruens and hydatidiform mole\n In acute lymphoblastic leukemia \n Used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in \nthe treatment of advanced stage non-Hodgkins lymphomas \n Treatment of breast cancer, epidermoid cancers of the head \nand neck, advanced mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma) and lung cancer, particularly squamous cell and small cell types \nii) Rheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular-Course Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis \n Indicated in the management of selected adults with severe, \nactive rheumatoid arthritis, or children with active \npolyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, who have had an insufficient therapeutic response to, or are intolerant of, an adequate trial of first-line therapy including full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) \niii) Psoriasis \n Indicated in the symptomatic control of severe, recalcitrant, \ndisabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy\nDOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATIONi) Neoplastic Diseases \n Choriocarcinoma and similar trophoblastic diseases: Orally or \nintramuscularly in doses of 15 to 30 mg daily for a five-day course. The courses are usually repeated for 3 to 5 times as required, with rest periods of one or more weeks interposed between courses, until any manifesting toxic symptoms subside. Since hydatidiform mole may precede choriocarcinoma, prophylactic chemotherapy with methotrexate has been recommended.

If menstrual bleeding is not adequately reduced by Trexam\n, an alternative treatment should be considered. \nG Patients with a previous thromboembolic event and a family history \nof thromboembolic disease (patients with thrombophilia) should use Tranexamic acid only if there is a strong medical indication and under strict medical supervision. \nG The blood levels are increased in patients with renal insufficiency. \nTherefore a dose reduction is recommended. \nG The use of tranexamic acid in cases of increased fibrinolysis due to \ndisseminated intravascular coagulation is not recommended. \nG Clinical experience with Tranexamic acid in menorrhagic children \nunder 15 years of age is not available. \nPregnancy and LactationPregnancy\nAlthough there is no evidence from animal studies of a teratogenic effect, the usual caution with use of drugs in pregnancy should be observed.\n \nTranexamic acid crosses the placenta. LactationTranexamic acid passes into breast milk to a concentration of approximately one hundredth of the concentration in the maternal blood. An antifibrinolytic effect in the infant is unlikely. \nUndesirable Effects\nG Gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) may occur \nbut disappear when the dosage is reduced.

      "description": "Descriptions\nBupivacaine is a long acting local anesthetic of the amide type. Bupivacaine spinal 5 mgml is a sterile non-glucose containing solution. Bupivacaine spinal has a rapid onset of action. The duration of analgesia is 3-5 hours in the lower thoracic and lumbar segments, which makes Bupivacaine spinal especially suitable for long lasting procedures in the lower limbs. The muscular relaxation of the lower limbs is profound, and lasts 3-4 hours, being somewhat shorter than the duration of the sensory blockade. The circulatory effects of Bupivacaine spinal are similar or less than those seen with other spinal agents. Bupivacaine spinal is well tolerated by all tissues with which it comes in contact.",
      "composition": "Not Found",
      "indications": "Indications\nBupivacaine is indicated for lower abdominal surgery (including Caesarean section), urological and lower limb, including hip surgery, lasting 1.5 to 3 hours.Bupivacaine is indicated for intrathecal (subarachnoid, spinal) anesthesia for surgical and obstetrical procedures.Bupivacaine produces motor blockade of the abdominal muscles makes the solution suitable for performance of abdominal surgery lasting 1.5-2 hours. The duration of motor blockade does not exceed the duration of analgesia.",
      "dosage": "Dosage & Administration\nThe following dosage recommendations should be regarded as a guide for use in the average adult: Spinal anesthesia for surgery: 2-4 ml (10-20 mg Bupivacaine hydrochloride) The patients physical status and concomitant medication should be considered when deciding the dose, and the lowest dose required for adequate anesthesia should be used. Duration varies with dose, while segmental spread may be difficult to predict, especially with the isobaric (plain) solution.The dose should be reduced in the elderly and in patients in the late stages of pregnancy.Pediatrics\nBupivacaine may be used in children. One of the differences between \nsmall children and adults is a relatively high CSF volume in infants and neonates, requiring a relatively larger dosekg to produce the same level of block as compared to adults.\n 5 kg: 0.40-0.50 mgkg\n5 to 15 kg: 0.30-0.40 mgkg15 to 40 kg: 0.25-0.30 mgkg\nSide Effects\nThe adverse reaction profile for Bupivacaine is similar to those for \nother long acting local anesthetics administered intrathecally. Adverse reactions caused by the drug per se are difficult to distinguish from the physiological effects of the nerve block (e.g. decrease in blood pressure, bradycardia, temporary urinary \nretention), events caused directly (e.g. nerve trauma) or indirectly \n(e.g. epidural abscess) by the needle puncture or events associated to cerebrospinal leakage.",

Acute active diseases of the cerebrospinal system such as \nmeningitis, tumours (primary or secondary), and poliomyelitis, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, cranial haemorrhage, demyelinating disease and raised intracranial pressure. 3. Spinal stenosis and active disease or recent trauma in the vertebral column. \nRelativeArthritis and other diseases of the vertebral column are relative contraindications due to technical difficulties in performing a spinal injection.\nUse in Pregnancy & Lactation\nIt is reasonable to assume that a large number of pregnant women \nand women of child-bearing age have been given Bupivacaine. No specific disturbances to the reproductive process have so far been \nreported, e.g. no increased incidence of malformations. It should be \nnoted that the dose should be reduced in patients in the late stages \nof pregnancy.

Bupivacaine spinal 5 mgml is a sterile non-glucose containing solution. Bupivacaine spinal has a rapid onset of action. The duration of analgesia is 3-5 hours in the lower thoracic and lumbar segments, which makes Bupivacaine spinal especially suitable for long lasting procedures in the lower limbs. The muscular relaxation of the lower limbs is profound, and lasts 3-4 hours, being somewhat shorter than the duration of the sensory blockade. The circulatory effects of Bupivacaine spinal are similar or less than those seen with other spinal agents. Bupivacaine spinal is well tolerated by all tissues with which it comes in contact.",

      "indications": "Indications\nVoriconazole is indicated in adults and children aged 2 years and above as follows:\n Treatment of invasive aspergillosis.\n Treatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic patients.\n Treatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including \nC. krusei).\n Treatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium \nspp. Voriconazole should be administered primarily to patients with progressive, \npossibly life-threatening infections. Prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in high \nrisk allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.",
      "dosage": "Dosage and Administration\nIn AdultsTherapy must be initiated with the specified loading dose regimen of either \nintravenous or oral Voriconazole to achieve plasma concentrations on day 1 that are \nclose to steady state. On the basis of the high oral bioavailability (96), switching \nbetween intravenous and oral administration is appropriate when clinically \nindicated.\n \nDuration of treatment\nTreatment duration should be as short as possible depending on the patients \nclinical and mycological response. Long term exposure to Voriconazole greater than \n180 days (6 months) requires careful assessment of the benefit-risk balance.\nProphylaxis in adults and children\nProphylaxis should be initiated on the day of transplant and may be administered for \nup to 100 days. Prophylaxis should be as short as possible depending on the risk for \ndeveloping invasive fungal infection (IFI) as defined by neutropenia or \nimmunosuppression.\nDosage in special population\nElderly\nNo dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients.\nRenal impairment\nThe pharmacokinetics of Voriconazole are not affected by renal impairment. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for oral dosing for patients with mild to \nsevere renal impairment.\nHepatic impairment\nIt is recommended that the standard loading dose regimens be used but that the \nmaintenance dose be halved in patients with mild to moderate hepatic cirrhosis \n(Child-Pugh A and B) receiving Voriconazole. Voriconazole has not been studied in \npatients with severe chronic hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C).\nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Voriconazole in children below 2 years has not been \nestablished.\nMethod of Administration\nVoriconazole tablets are to be taken at least one hour before, or one hour following, a meal. Voriconazole injection requires reconstitution and dilution prior to \nadministration as an intravenous infusion.\nVoriconazole PFS requires reconstitution prior to oral administration. Voriconazole \nsuspension is to be taken at least one hour before, or two hours following, a meal.\nReconstitution Direction (Injection)\n This medicinal product is for single use only and any unused solution should be \ndiscarded.\n To prepare the Voriconazole vial for reconstitution, remove the plastic cap from the \nvial and wipe the top with an antiseptic swab.\n The Voriconazole powder is reconstituted by using the provided syringe to remove \n19 ml of Voriconazole solvent for solution for infusion (Sterile Water for Injection) \nfrom the ampoule. The Voriconazole solvent for solution for infusion is then added to the vial from the \nfilled syringe into the vial.\n This will provide an extractable volume of 20 ml of clear concentrate containing 10 \nmgml of Voriconazole. Ensure that the Voriconazole powder has completely \ndissolved and no particulates are visible (do not shake).\nFor dilution\n Voriconazole must be infused over 1-2 hours, at a concentration of 5 mgml or \nless. Therefore, the required volume of the 10 mgml Voriconazole concentrate \nshould be further diluted as follows:\n Calculate the volume of 10 mgml Voriconazole concentrate required based on the \npatients weight (as per the table given below).\n In order to allow the required volume of Voriconazole to be added, withdraw and \ndiscard at least an equal volume of diluent from the infusion bag to be used. The \nvolume of diluent remaining in the bag should be such that when the 10 mgml \nVoriconazole concentrate is added the final concentration is not less than 0.5 mgml \nnor greater than 5 mgml.\n Using a suitable size syringe and aseptic technique, withdraw the required volume \nof Voriconazole concentrate from the appropriate number of vials and add to the \ninfusion bag. Discard partially used vials.\n The final Voriconazole solution must be infused over 1-2 hours at a maximum rate \nof 3 mgkg per hour.Reconstitution Direction (Suspension)\nShake the bottle well before adding water to loosen the powder. Add 25 ml of boiled \nand cooled water to the bottle (5 spoon of provided spoon). Shake the closed bottle \nvigorously until powder mixed completely with the water.\nOverdose\nIn an overdose, haemodialysis may assist in the removal of Voriconazole and SBECD \nfrom the body.",

      "indications": "Indications\n1. Hypertension\nAmlodipine is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.\n2. Stable Angina\nAmlodipine is indicated for the treatment of stable angina. Amlodipine may be used alone or in \ncombination with other antianginal agents.\n3. Vasospastic Angina\nAmlodipine is indicated for the treatment of \nconfirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. \nAmlodipine may be used as monotherapy or in \ncombination with other antianginal drugs.",
      "dosage": "Dosage and administration\nThe usual initial antihypertensive oral dose is 5 mg once daily with a maximum dose of 10 mg once daily. Elderly individuals or patients with hepatic \ninsufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily \ndose and this dose may be used when adding Amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy. Dosage should be adjusted according to each patients need. The recommended dose for stable or vasospastic angina is 5-10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic \ninsufficiency.\nContraindication\nAmlodipine is contraindicated in patients with known \nhypersensitivity to Amlodipine.\nPregnancy & Lactation\nPregnancy: Amlodipine should not be administered \nduring pregnancy or to women of childbearing \npotential unless effective contraception is used.Lactation: Amlodipine should not be used by nursing mothers. If its use is considered necessary, breast-feeding should be stopped.\nPrecautions\nGeneral : Since the vasodilatation induced by Amlodipine is gradual in onset, acute hypotension has rarely been reported after oral administration of  Amlodipine. Nonetheless, caution should be \nexercised when administering Amlodipine as with \nany other peripheral vasodilator particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis.Use in Patient with congestive Heart Failure : Although \nhaemodynamic studies and a controlled trial in \nclass-ll-llI heart failure patients have shown that \nAmlodipine did not lead to clinical deterioration as \nmeasured by exercise tolerance, left ventricular \nejection fraction, and clinical symptomatology in \ngeneral, all calcium channel blockers should be used \nwith caution in patients with heart failure.\nBeta-blocker Withdrawal :  Amlodipine gives no \nprotection against the danger of abrupt beta-blocker  \nwithdrawal; any such withdrawal should be gradual reduction of the dose of beta-blocker.\nHepatic Failure :  Since Amlodipine is extensively \nmetabolized by the liver, so caution should be \nexercised when administering Amlodipine to patients with hepatic impairment.\nDrug Interactions\nNo significant drug interaction.\nSide effects\nPeripheral oedema may occasionally be severe but is \nfully reversible. As with other calcium antagonist \ndrugs, peripheral oedema and skin erythema occur in a proportion of patients (5-10) and facial flushing in 2-5 of patients. Complaint of fatigue was also reported more frequently than in placebo-treated patients.\nThere is evidence that these effects are more \ncommon in patients treated with doses greater than 10 mg daily.\nOverdosage\nIn humans, experience with intentional overdosage of \nAmlodipine is limited. If massive overdosage occurs, \nactive cardiac and respiratory monitoring should be instituted. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential.\nCommercial Pack\nXelcard 5 : Box containing 3x10s tablets in blister \npack.\nXelcard 10 : Box containing 3x10s tablets in blister \npack. \nSTORAGE\nStore in a cool and dry place below 30 ºC.

      "composition": "Composition \nXelpid  Tablet 10 mg: Each film coated tablet contains Atorvastatin Calcium \nUSP 10.82 mg equivalent to Atorvastatin 10 mg.\nXelpid Tablet 20 mg: Each film coated tablet contains Atorvastatin Calcium \nUSP 21.64 mg equivalent to Atorvastatin 20 mg.\nXelpid Tablet 40 mg: Each film coated tablet contains Atorvastatin Calcium \nUSP 43.28 mg equivalent to Atorvastatin 40 mg.\nProperties & effects \nAtorvastatin calcium is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent. Atorvastatin is an \ninhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. \nThis enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early and \nrate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.\nPharmacodynamics\nAtorvastatin as well as some of its metabolites are pharmacologically active in \nhumans. The liver is the primary site of action and the principal site of \ncholesterol synthesis and LDL clearance. Drug dosage rather than systemic \ndrug concentration correlates better with LDL-C reduction. Individualization of \ndrug dosage should be based on therapeutic response. \nPharmacokinetics \nAbsorption\nAtorvastatin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration; maximum plasma \nconcentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours. Extent of absorption increases in \nproportion to Atorvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of Atorvastatin \n(parent drug) is approximately 14 and the systemic availability of HMG-CoA \nreductase inhibitory activity is approximately 30. \nDistribution \nMean volume of distribution of Atorvastatin is approximately 381 liters. \nAtorvastatin is 98 bound to plasma proteins. A bloodplasma ratio of \napproximately 0.25 indicates poor drug penetration into red blood cells. Based \non observations in rats, Atorvastatin is likely to be secreted in human milk. \nMetabolism\nAtorvastatin is extensively metabolized to ortho- and parahydroxylated \nderivatives and various beta-oxidation products. In vitro inhibition of HMG-CoA \nreductase by ortho- and parahydroxylated metabolites is equivalent to that of \nAtorvastatin. Approximately 70 of circulating inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA \nreductase is attributed to active metabolites. In vitro studies suggest the \nimportance of Atorvastatin metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4, consistent \nwith increased plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin in humans following \ncoadministration with erythromycin, a known inhibitor of this isozymes. In \nanimals, the ortho-hydroxy metabolite undergoes further glucuronidation.\nExcretion\nAtorvastatin and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in bile following \nhepatic andor extra-hepatic metabolism; however, the drug does not appear to \nundergo enterohepatic recirculation. Mean plasma elimination half-life of \nAtorvastatin in humans is approximately 14 hours, but the half-life of inhibitory \nactivity for HMG-CoA reductase is 20 to 30 hours due to the contribution of \nactive metabolites. Less than 2 of a dose of Atorvastatin is recovered in urine \nfollowing oral administration.\nSpecial Populations\nGeriatric\nPlasma concentrations of Atorvastatin are higher (approximately 40 for Cmax \nand 30 for AUC) in healthy elderly subjects (age 65 years) than in young \nadults. Clinical data suggest a greater degree of LDL-lowering at any dose of \ndrug in the elderly patient population compared to younger adults. \nPediatric\nPharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population are not available.\nGender\nThere is no clinically significant difference in LDL-C reduction with Atorvastatin \nbetween men and women.\nRenal Insufficiency\nRenal disease has no influence on the plasma concentrations or LDL-C \nreduction of Atorvastatin; thus, dose adjustment in patients with renal \ndysfunction is not necessary.\nHemodialysis\nHemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance clearance of Atorvastatin \nsince the drug is extensively bound to plasma proteins.\nHepatic Insufficiency\nIn patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease, plasma concentrations of \nAtorvastatin are markedly increased. \nIndications\nAtorvastatin is indicated \n1. As an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total cholesterol, LDL-C, \napolipoprotein B, and triglycerides (TG) levels and to increase HDL-C in \npatients with primary hypercholesterolemia  and mixed dyslipidemia. \n2. As an adjunct to diet for the treatment of patients with elevated serum TG levels. \n3. For the treatment of patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia  who do \nnot respond adequately to diet.\n4. To reduce total cholesterol and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial \nhypercholesterolemia as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments.\n5. As an adjunct to diet to reduce total-C, LDL-C, and apolipoprotein B levels in \nboys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous \nfamilial hypercholesterolemia.\nDosage and Administration\nThe patient should be placed on a standard cholesterol-lowering diet before \nreceiving Atorvastatin and should continue on this diet during treatment with Atorvastatin. The recommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 or 20 mg \nonce daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45) \nmay be started at 40 mg once daily. The dosage range of Atorvastatin is 10 to \n80 mg once daily. Atorvastatin can be administered as a single dose at any time \nof the day, with or without food.  After initiation of Atorvastatin lipid levels \nshould be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and dosage adjusted accordingly.\nIn hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients (10-17 years of age) the \nrecommended starting dose of Atorvastatin is 10 mgday; the maximum \nrecommended dose is 20 mgday (doses greater than 20 mg have not been \nstudied in this patient population). Doses should be individualized according to \nthe recommended goal of therapy. Adjustments should be made at intervals of \n4 weeks or more.\nContraindications\nActive liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum \ntransaminases.\nHypersensitivity to any component of this medication.\nPrecautions\nBefore instituting therapy with Atorvastatin, an attempt should be made to \ncontrol hypercholesterolemia with appropriate diet, exercise, and weight \nreduction in obese patients, and to treat other underlying medical problems.\nPregnancy and Lactation\nHMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are contraindicated during pregnancy and in \nnursing mothers. ATORVASTATIN SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED TO WOMEN \nOF CHILDBEARING AGE ONL Y WHEN SUCH PATIENTS ARE HIGHL Y \nUNLIKEL Y TO CONCEIVE AND HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POTENTIAL \nHAZARDS. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, therapy \nshould be discontinued and the patient apprised of the potential hazard to the \nfetus.\nAdverse Reactions\nAtorvastatin is generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse events \nthought to be related to atorvastatin were constipation, flatulence, dyspepsia, \nand abdominal pain. \nDrug Interactions\nThe risk of myopathy during treatment with drugs of this class is increased with \nconcurrent administration of cyclosporine, fibric acid derivatives, niacin \n(nicotinic acid), erythromycin, azole antifungals. \nAntacid:  When atorvastatin and antacid suspension were coadministered, \nplasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 35. However, \nLDL-C reduction was not altered.\nColestipol: Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin decreased approximately 25 \nwhen colestipol and atorvastatin were coadministered. However, LDL-C \nreduction was greater when atorvastatin and colestipol were coadministered \nthan when either drug was given alone.\nDigoxin: When multiple doses of atorvastatin and digoxin were coadministered, \nsteady-state plasma digoxin concentrations increased by approximately 20. \nPatients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately.\nErythromycin:  In healthy individuals, plasma concentrations of atorvastatin \nincreased approximately 40 with coadministration of atorvastatin and \nerythromycin, a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4. \nOral Contraceptives: Coadministration of atorvastatin and an oral contraceptive \nincreased AUC values for norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol by approximately \n30 and 20. These increases should be considered when selecting an oral \ncontraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.\nWarfarin: Atorvastatin had no clinically significant effect on prothrombin time \nwhen administered to patients receiving chronic warfarin treatment.\nOverdosage\nThere is no specific treatment for atorvastatin overdosage. In the event of an \noverdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically, and supportive \nmeasures instituted as required. Due to extensive drug binding to plasma \nproteins, hemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance atorvastatin \nclearance.\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30 ºC in a dry place.

      "composition": "Composition\nYulipris Tablet: Each tablet contains Ulipristal Acetate \nINN 5 mg.\nPharmacology\nThe active substance in Yulipris (ulipristal acetate) is a \nselective progesterone receptor modulator. It acts by blocking the receptor of a hormone in the body called progesterone, which is involved in controlling the growth of the lining of the womb. In some women, progesterone may promote the growth of fibroids, which may cause symptoms such as heavy uterine bleeding, anaemia and abdominal pain. When progesterone activity is blocked, fibroid cells stop dividing and eventually die which reduces the size of the fibroids and reduces the symptoms caused by them.\nIndications \nYulipris\n is used before surgery to treat moderate to \nsevere symptoms of uterine fibroids, which are noncancerous (benign) tumors of the womb (uterus). Yulipris\n is used in adult women who have not yet reached \nmenopause\nDosage and Administration\nYulipris is taken by mouth and the recommended dose is \none tablet a day for up to three months. The three month treatment can be repeated but only once. Treatment should always be started during the first week of the menstrual cycle (period bleeding).\nContraindications\n  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.  Pregnancy and breastfeeding. Genital bleeding of unknown aetiology or for reasons   other than uterine fibroids.  Uterine, cervical, ovarian or breast cancer.\nPrecautions\nUlipristal acetate should only be prescribed after careful diagnosis. Pregnancy should be precluded prior to treatment.  Contraception  Renal impairment Hepatic impairment  Asthma patients Endometrial changesPatients should be informed that treatment with ulipristal acetate usually leads to a significant reduction in menstrual blood loss or amenorrhea within the first 10 days of treatment.

      "composition": "COMPOSITION\nZandra Solution for IV Infusion 5 mg100 mL: Each vial \ncontains Zoledronic Acid Monohydrate INN 5.33 mg \nequivalent to Zoledronic Acid 5 mg.\nPHARMACOLOGY\nZoledronic acid is a bisphosphonate and acts primarily on \nbone. It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. \nThe selective action of bisphosphonates on bone is based on \ntheir high affinity for mineralized bone. Intravenously \nadministered zoledronic acid rapidly partitions to bone and \nlocalizes preferentially at sites of high bone turnover. The \nmain molecular target of zoledronic acid in the osteoclast is \nthe enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. The relatively \nlong duration of action of zoledronic acid is attributable to its \nhigh binding affinity to bone mineral. \nINDICATION  \n Treatment and prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis\n Treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis\n Treatment and prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis\n Treatment of Pagets disease of bone in men and women \nLimitations of Use\nOptimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients \nat low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 \nto 5 years of use.\nDOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION\nImportant Administration Instructions\nZoledronic acid injection must be administered as an \nintravenous infusion over no less than 15 minutes\n Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to \nadministration of zoledronic acid \n Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for \nparticulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, \nwhenever solution and container permit\n Intravenous infusion should be followed by a 10 mL normal \nsaline flush of the intravenous line\n Administration of acetaminophen following zoledronic acid \nadministration may reduce the incidence of acute-phase \nreaction symptoms\n Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women\nThe recommended regimen is a 5 mg infusion once a year \ngiven intravenously over no less than 15 minutes.\n Prevention of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women\nThe recommended regimen is a 5 mg infusion given once \nevery 2 years intravenously over no less than 15 minutes.\n Osteoporosis in Men\nThe recommended regimen is a 5 mg infusion once a year \ngiven intravenously over no less than 15 minutes.\n Treatment and Prevention of Glucocorticoid-Induced \nOsteoporosis\nThe recommended regimen is a 5 mg infusion once a year \ngiven intravenously over no less than 15 minutes.\n Treatment of Pagets  Disease of Bone\nThe recommended dose is a 5 mg infusion. The infusion time \nmust not be less than 15 minutes given over a constant \ninfusion rate.\nRe-treatment of Pagets Disease\nRe-treatment with zoledronic acid may be considered in \npatients who have relapsed, based on increases in serum \nalkaline phosphatase, or in those patients who failed to \nachieve normalization of their serum alkaline phosphatase, or \nin those patients with symptoms, as dictated by medical \npractice.\nCalcium and Vitamin D Supplementation\n Instruct patients being treated for Pagets disease of bone on \nthe importance of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in \nmaintaining serum calcium levels, and on the symptoms of \nhypocalcemia. All patients should take 1500 mg elemental \ncalcium daily in divided doses (750 mg two times a day, or \n500 mg three times a day) and 800 international units vitamin \nD daily, particularly in the 2 weeks following zoledronic acid \nadministration \n Instruct patients being treated for osteoporosis to take \nsupplemental calcium and vitamin D if their dietary intake is \ninadequate. An average of at least 1200 mg calcium and \n800-1000 international units vitamin D daily is recommended\nMethod of Administration\n The zoledronic acid infusion time must not be less than 15 \nminutes given over a constant infusion rate\n The intravenous infusion should be followed by a 10 mL \nnormal saline flush of the intravenous line\n Zoledronic acid solution for infusion must not be allowed to \ncome in contact with any calcium or other divalent \ncation-containing solutions, and should be administered as a \nsingle intravenous solution through a separate vented infusion \nline\n If refrigerated, allow the refrigerated solution to reach room \ntemperature before administration. After opening, the solution \nis stable for 24 hours at 2C to 8C (36F to 46F)\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\n Hypocalcemia \n Patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mLmin and \nin those with evidence of acute renal impairment  Hypersensitivity to any component of zoledronic acid \nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \n Hypocalcemia may worsen during treatment. Patients must \nbe adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D \n Renal Impairment: A single dose should not exceed 5 mg \nand the duration of infusion should be no less than 15 \nminutes. Renal toxicity may be greater in patients with \nunderlying renal impairment or with other risk factors, \nincluding advanced age or dehydration. Monitor creatinine \nclearance before each dose \n Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) has been reported. All \npatients should have a routine oral exam by the prescriber \nprior to treatment \n Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with \nthigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral \nfracture \n Severe Bone, Joint, and Muscle Pain may occur. Withhold \nfuture doses of zoledronic acid if severe symptoms occur\nADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe most common adverse reactions (greater than 10) were \npyrexia, myalgia, headache, arthralgia, pain in extremity. Other \nimportant adverse reactions were flu-like illness, nausea, \nvomiting, diarrhea, and eye inflammation \nUSE IN PREGANCY & LACTATION\n Pregnancy: Zoledronic acid can cause fetal harm.

      "composition": "Composition\nZeropain tablet:  Each film coated tablet contains Ketorolac Tromethamine USP 10 mg.\nPharmacology\nZeropain is a potent analgesic agent of NSAID class. Its mode of action is to inhibit the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme system \nand hence prostaglandin synthesis and it demonstrates a minimal anti-inflammatory effect at its analgesic dose. Plasma \nhalf-life is on average 5.3 hours in young adults and 7 hours in elderly patients (mean age 72). More than 99 of the \nketorolac tromethamine in plasma is protein-bound over a wide concentration range.\nIndication\nShort-term management of moderate to severe acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level. \nDosage & administration\nUsual dose: Adult: injection- 10-30mg 4-6 hourly, maximum 5 days; tablet- 10mg 4-6 hourly, maximum 7 days. Children (2 \nyears): injection (I.V.)- 0.5mgkg 6 hourly, maximum 2 days; tablet- not established.\nDescriptive doses:\nNote: When converting from parenteral to oral administration, total combined dose on the day of conversion should not \nexceed 120 mg (60 mg for 65 years of age or renally impaired or body mass 50kg) of which the oral should not exceed 40mg.\nCombination treatment\n(See also Drug Interactions) Opioid analgesics (e.g. morphine, pethidine) may be used concomitantly, and may be required for optimal analgesic effect in the early postoperative period when pain is most severe. Ketorolac tromethamine does not interfere with opioid binding and does not exacerbate opioid-related respiratory depression or sedation.\nContraindications\nGastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, related to previous NSAIDs therapy, severe heart failure, moderate to severe renal impairment, in labour and delivery, suspected or confirmed cerebrovascular bleeding, patients receiving ASA or other NSAIDs and hypersensitivity to NSAIDs. \nWarning & precautions\nUse with other NSAIDs, coagulation disorder, hypertension, mild to moderate congestive heart failure, impaired renal function, asthma, liver dysfunction, skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Patients receiving oral corticosteroids, warfarin, SSRIs, or antiplatelets.\nSide effects\nNausea, dyspepsia, gastro-intestinal painbleeding, vomiting, haemorrhage, perforation, headache, sweating, dry mouth, \nacute renal failure, hyponatraemia, bradycardia, hypertension, asthma, bronchospasm, rash, postoperative wound \nhaemorrhage, abnormalities of liver function tests.\nUse in pregnancy & lactation\nThe safety of Ketorolac tromethamine  in human pregnancy has not been established. Pregnancy Category C, Contraindicated in nursing mother.\nUse in children and adolescents\nChildren (2 years): injection (I.V.)- 0.5mgkg 6 hourly, maximum 2 days; tablet- not established.\nDrug interactions\nProbenecid, lithium, other NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors.\nOverdose   \nDoses of 360mg given intramuscularly over an 8-hour interval for five consecutive days have caused abdominal pain and \npeptic ulcers which have healed after discontinuation of dosing. Two patients recovered from unsuccessful suicide attempts. \nOne patient experienced nausea after 210mg ketorolac, and the other hyperventilation after 300mg ketorolac.\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30 ºC in a dry place.

      "composition": "Composition\nZilas  Tablet 20 mg : Each Tablet contains Bilastine INN 20 \nmg.\nPharmacology\nZilas  is a non sedative, long acting histamine antagonist with \nselective peripheral H1 receptor antagonist and no affinity for \nmuscarinic receptors, serotogenic, dopaminergic receptors. It has been developed for the symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis & Urticaria. It is an antiallergic agent whose main mechanism of action is the inhibition of immune system reactions mediated by the interaction of histamine on its H\n1 \nreceptor. The affinity and selectivity of Bilastine for the human H1 receptor was investigated in vitro. Bilastine was shown to have high affinity and selectivity to the H\n1 receptor.\nIndicationZilas \n 20 mg Tablet is indicated for the symptomatic treatment \nof allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria in adults.\nDose and Administration\nZilas  one tablet (20 mg) once daily for the relief of symptoms \nof allergic rhino-conjunctivitis (seasonal & perennial) and urticaria in adults. The tablet should be taken by oral route one hour before or two hours after intake of food or fruit juice.\nContraindication\nHypersensitivity to Zilas  \n or any other ingredient or \ncomponent. A history of QT prolongation including congenital long QT syndromes.\nWarning & Precaution\nZilas \n should not be used in patients with a history of QTc \nprolongation including congenital long QT syndromes. Particular care should be exercised when administering antihistamine who have a history of cardiac arrhythmias, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, significant bradycardia, family history of sudden cardiac death and many more. No dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. Since Bilastine is not metabolized, hepatic impairment is not expected to increase systemic exposure above the safety margin. Therefore, no hepatic adjustment is required for hepatic impairment.\nSide Effects\nThe most common side effects are headache, drowsiness & fatigue.\nPregnancy & Lactation\nThere are no adequate and well controlled studies on pregnancy outcome with Bilastine in pregnant women. Also, the excretion of Bilastine in milk has not been studied in humans and there are no or limited amount of clinical data available on fertility. So it is better to avoid Zilas \n during \npregnancy.Children & AdolescentThe safety and efficacy of Zilas \n in children under 12 years of \nage have not been established.\nDrug Interaction\nConcomitant administration of Bilastine 20 mg, Ketoconazole 400 mg once daily & Erythromycin 500 mg three times daily increased Zilas  \n AUC 2 fold and Cmax 2-3 fold. These \nchanges can be explained by interaction with intestinal efflux transporters, since bilastine is substrate for P-gp and not metabolized. These changes doesnt affect the safety of Zilas \n. \nOther medicinal products that are substrates or inhibitors of P-gp, such as cyclosporine, may likewise have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of Bilastine.\nInteraction with Diltiazem: Concomitant intake of Zilas \n 20 \nmg o.d. and diltiazem 60 mg once daily increased Cmax of \nBilastine by 50 and does not appear to affect the safety profile of Bilastine.\nInteraction with Alcohol: The psychomotor performance after \nconcomitant intake of alcohol and 20 mg Zilas \n once daily \nwas similar to that observed after intake of alcohol and placebo.\nInteraction with Lorazepam: Concomitant intake of Zilas \n \n20 mg once daily and lorazepam 3 mg once daily for 8 days did \nnot potentiate the depressant CNS effects of lorazepam.\nOver Dose\nFrequency of treatment emergent adverse events was two times higher than with placebo in case of overdose of Zilas \n. \nThe adverse reactions most frequently reported were dizziness, headache & nausea.\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30C in a dry place.

      "composition": "Composition\nZopime 500 mg IVIM injection: Each vial contains sterile Cefepime Hydrochloride with L-Arginine USP 1 g equivalent to \nCefepime 500 mg.\nZopime 1 g IVIM injection: Each vial contains sterile Cefepime Hydrochloride with L-Arginine USP 2 g equivalent to \nCefepime 1 g.\nPharmacology\nZopime (Cefepime Hydrochloride, USP) is a semi-synthetic, broad spectrum, 4th generation cephalosporin \nantibiotic for parenteral administration. Cefepime disrupt the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls. The peptidoglycan layer is important for cell wall structural integrity.\nIndications\nZopime is indicated in adults for the treatment of the infections listed below when caused by susceptible \nbacteria. \nG  Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia and bronchitis. \nG  Urinary tract infections, both complicated, including pyelonephritis, and uncomplicated infections. \nG  Skin and skin structure infections. \nG  Septicaemia. \nG  Intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis and biliary tract infections \nG  Empiric treatment of febrile neutropenia\nDosage And Administration\nThe recommended adult and pediatric dosages and routes of administration are outlined in the following table. \nZopime should be administered intravenously over approximately 30 minutes. \n Site and type of infection Dose Frequency Duration (Days)\n Moderate to Severe 1-2 g IV Every 12 hours 10\n Pneumonia due to S.\n pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa,\n K. pneumoniae, or Enterobacter\n species\n Empiric therapy for febrile 2 g IV Every 8 hours 7\n neutropenic patients\n Mild to Moderate 0.5-1 g IVIM Every 12 hours 7-10\n Uncomplicated or\n Complicated Urinary\n Tract Infections, including\n pyelonephritis, due to E. coli,\n K. pneumoniae, or P. mirabilis \n Severe Uncomplicated or 2 g IV Every 12 hours 10\n Complicated Urinary Tract\n Infections, including\n pyelonephritis, due to\n E. coli or K. pneumoniae \n Moderate to Severe 2 g IV Every 12 hours 10\n Uncomplicated Skin \n and Skin Structure\n Infections due to S.\n aureus or S. pyogenes  Complicated Intra- 2 g IV Every 12 hours 7-10\n abdominal Infections\nPediatric Patients (2 months up to 16 years)\nThe usual recommended dosage in pediatric patients up to 40 kg in weight for uncomplicated and complicated \nurinary tract infections (including pyelonephritis), uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, and \npneumonia is 50 mg per kg per dose, administered every 12 hours (50 mg per kg per dose, every 8 hours for \nfebrile neutropenic patients), for durations as given above.\nReconstitution \n Vials Amount of diluents to be added (ml)\n 500mg IV 5.0\n 500mg IM 1.3\n 1g IV 10.0\n 1g IM 2.4\nContraindications\nZopime is contraindicated in patients who have shown immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cefepime or the \ncephalosporin class of antibiotics, penicillins or other beta-lactam antibiotics.Warnings And Precautions\nAs with other antibiotics, prolonged use of  \nZopime may result in overgrowth of  nonsusceptible organisms. If an \nallergic reaction to Zopime occurs, discontinue the drug  and treat the patient appropriately. In patients with \nimpaired renal function the dosage of Zopime should be adjusted.\nSide Effects\nCommon adverse reactions are \nHypersensitivity - rash (1.8), pruritus, urticaria. \nGastrointestinal - nausea, vomiting, oral moniliasis, diarrhea (1.2), colitis (including \npseudomembranous colitis) \nCentral nervous system - headache Other - fever, vaginitis, erythema \nUse in special population\nUsage in Pregnancy\nPregnancy Category B. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies of cefepime use in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be \nused during pregnancy only if clearly needed.\nNursing Mothers\nCefepime is excreted in human breast milk in very low concentrations (0.5 mcgmL). Caution should be exercised \nwhen cefepime is administered to a nursing woman.\nPediatric Use\nSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 months have not been established. There are \ninsufficient clinical data to support the use of \nZopime in pediatric patients under 2 months of age.\nGeriatric Use\nSerious adverse events have occurred in geriatric patients with renal insufficiency given unadjusted doses of \ncefepime, including life-threatening or fatal occurrences of the following: encephalopathy, myoclonus, and seizures.\nDrug interactions\nRenal function should be carefully monitored if high doses of aminoglycosides are to be  administered with  \ncefepime or if aminoglycoside therapy is prolonged, because of the  potential nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of \naminoglycoside antibiotics. Nephrotoxicity has  been reported following concomitant administration of other \ncephalosporins with  aminoglycoside antibiotics or potent diuretics such as frusemide.\nStorage\nStore  in a cool and dry place below 25 º C.

It is extensively distributed \nin tissue, with an apparent central volume of distribution (Vd) of 5630 L .\nMetabolism:\nAbiraterone is metabolised in the liver by CYP3A4 and SULT2A1 to inactive \nmetabolites. \nExcretion:\nThe drug is excreted in feces (88) and urine (5), and has a terminal \nhalf-life of 12  5 hours.\nContra-indication\nIt contraindicates patients with hypersensitivity to the Abiraterone acetate \nor to any ingredients of the excipients of Abiraterone.\nWarning & precautions\nAbiraterone may cause hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention as a \nconsequence of increased mineralocorticoid levels resulting from CYP17 \ninhibition. In the two randomized clinical trials, grade 3 to 4 hypertension \noccurred in 2 of patients, grade 3 to 4 hypokalemia in 4 of patients, \nand grade 3 to 4 edema in 1 of patients treated with Abirateron\nSide effects\nThe side effects of Abiraterone include hypertension, hypokalemia, and \nfluid retention due to mineralocorticoid excess, adrenocortical \ninsufficiency, hepatotoxicity.\nPregnancy and lactation\nThere are no human data on the use of Abiraterone in pregnancy and it is \nnot for use in women of childbearing potential. Maternal use of a CYP17 \ninhibitor is expected to produce changes in hormone levels that could \naffect development of the foetus.Pregnancy: \nAbiraterone acetate is contraindicated in women who are or may \npotentially by pregnant.\nBreast feeding: \nIt is not known that abiraterone acetate or its metabolites are excreted in \nhuman milk\nUse in special population\nGeriatrics Use:\nNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between \nyounger & older patients\nPediatrics Use: \nAbiraterone has not been studied in children\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment:\nPatients with pre-existing moderate or severe hepatic impairment should \nnot receive Abiraterone.  For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during \ntreatment, suspension of treatment and dosage adjustment may be \nrequired\nPatients with Renal Impairment: \nNo dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment\nDrug interactions\nCYP3A4 Inducers: \nStrong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, \nrifabutin, phenobarbital) during treatment with Abiraterone are to be \navoided. If patients must be co-administered a strong CYP3A4 inducer \nwith Abiraterone, careful evaluation of clinical efficacy must be \nundertaken as there are no clinical data recommending an appropriate \ndose adjustment.\nCYP3A4 Inhibitors: \nCo-administration of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor with \nAbiraterone shows no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics \nof abiraterone.\nOverdose\nThere have been no reports of overdose during clinical studies. There is no \nspecific antidote. In the event of an overdose, administration should be \nwithheld and general supportive measures undertaken, including \nmonitoring for arrhythmias, hypokalaemia and for signs and symptoms of \nfluid retention. Liver function also should be assessed.\nStorage\nStore at temperature not exceeding 30ºC in a dry place.",
